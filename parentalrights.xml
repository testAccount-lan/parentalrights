<![CDATA[<p>I need your help today to advance the Parental Rights Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in Congress. Could you take a moment to call or even line up a visit with your congressman to urge his or her support?</p>



<p>The Parental Rights Amendment is currently introduced in Congress by Debbie Lesko (AZ) as House Joint Resolution 38 (<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-joint-resolution/38" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">H.J. Res. 38</a>). Because of the stark partisan divisions in Congress, we don’t necessarily expect the Amendment to pass this session. But that doesn’t mean we can’t further the discussion and better pave the way for its future passage.</p>



<p>And to do that, <strong>we need your congressman’s support.</strong>
</p>



<p>You see, Governor Glenn Younkin’s election in 2021 on the issue of parental rights has sent a strong political message: <strong>the issue of parental rights resonates with Virginia voters.</strong>&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>The Parental Rights Foundation is a non-partisan organization; we’re not endorsing one party over another. I’m simply acknowledging the political reality that parental rights has especially resonated with voters in Virginia—and it’s one your member of Congress will recognize, as well.</p>



<p>That’s why I’m asking you to reach out and ask your U.S. Representative to sign onto H.J.Res. 38 as a cosponsor.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>The plan is simple: the more cosponsors the Amendment gets, the easier it is to gain more. <strong>And once we get enough, we can ask for a subcommittee hearing on the resolution, which will further the discussion on constitutional parental rights. </strong>And that will help pave the way for future passage.</p>



<p>The challenge is that, with only eight current cosponsors, it’s not so easy to gain more. That’s why the political reality I mentioned above is so important: of all the members of Congress who could sign on, <em>your Virginia representative should be among those most ready to do so.</em>
</p>



<p>What’s more, Congress is on recess throughout the month of August to allow your congressman to be right there in your district.</p>



<p>
<strong>Take Action Today!</strong>
</p>



<p>So here’s the action item, and there are two options:</p>



<p>
<strong>Option 1</strong>: Please take a moment right now to <strong>call your congressman’s district office</strong> (see numbers below) and ask that your congressman sign on as a cosponsor of H.J.Res. 38, the Parental Rights Amendment. Explain that our goal is to get enough cosponsors for a subcommittee hearing so that we can further the discussion of parental rights, and remind them that if Glenn Younkin’s election tells us anything, it is that Virginia legislators can safely back parental rights.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Be polite and courteous when you call and ask if they could send you an email response to your request.</p>



<p>
<strong>Option 2:</strong> Because your lawmaker is in the district office, you can <strong>stop in and see them!</strong> Call the district office first to make an appointment (numbers below).&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Then, try to take a friend or two with you. A large group can seem overwhelming or even threatening, but a group of two or three is enough to communicate that you are not alone in your interest in this cause.</p>



<p>Dress professionally and be sure to arrive on time, or even a couple of minutes early.</p>



<p>
<strong>When you are there, simply make the same ask outlined in Option 1 above:</strong> that you want them to cosponsor H.J.Res. 38, that our goal is to gain enough cosponsors for a hearing to further the discussion of parental rights, and that Glenn Younkin’s election makes it clear that this is a safe and even a strong issue for legislators in Virginia to support.</p>



<p>You can also print out a couple of copies of this <a href="https://parentalrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Why-We-Need-the-PRA-2023-Michael-Ramey-President.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one-pager</a> (front and back) to take with you and leave with them.</p>



<p>Be polite and courteous and ask them if they could email you a response when they’ve made their decision.</p>



<p>
<strong>Virginia Congressmen:</strong>
</p>



<p>District 1: Rob Wittman Tappahannock (804) 443-0668</p>



<p>Glen Allen (804) 401-4120</p>



<p>&amp;nbsp; Yorktown &amp;nbsp; (757) 527-6270</p>



<p>District 2:&amp;nbsp; Jen Kiggans Virginia Beach (757) 364-7650</p>



<p>Onley (757) 666-6020</p>



<p>Suffolk (757) 942-6050</p>



<p>District 5: Bob Good Lynchburg (434) 791-2596</p>



<p>District 9: Morgan Griffith Abingdon (276) 525-1405</p>



<p>Christiansburg (540) 381-5671</p>



<p>If you’re not sure which district you are in, <a href="https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">click here</a> and enter your zip code.</p>



<p>Thank you for taking the time to stand with us to promote parental rights in Congress!</p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>



<p>Michael Ramey<br>President</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Alabama’s fundamental parental rights bill, <a href="https://legiscan.com/AL/bill/HB6/2023" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">House Bill 6</a>, is running out of time and we need your help immediately.</p>



<p>H.B. 6, championed by <a href="https://alison.legislature.state.al.us/house-leaders-members?tab=1&amp;search=Paschal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rep. Kenneth Paschal</a>, received bipartisan support in the House, where it passed by a vote of 87-8 (plus 7 not voting and 3 abstained) on May 24, and again in the Senate, where it <em>passed unanimously</em> on May 31. Now it needs only the signature of Governor Kay Ivey to become law.</p>



<p>After months of debates and amendments in the legislature, this should be the easy part. Instead, <strong>we are hours away from the governor’s “pocket veto,” which will go into effect if the bill is not signed this week.</strong> (The “pocket veto” means that any bill not signed by this Friday is essentially vetoed, even without a specific veto action.)</p>



<p>This excellent bill, which establishes that parental rights are fundamental and that they may not be burdened by the state except under strict judicial scrutiny, deserves a better destiny than the pocket veto. It deserves to be signed into Alabama law!</p>



<p>And that’s where you come in.</p>



<p>
<strong>Please take a moment right now, before you close this email, to call the governor’s office and urge her to sign H.B. 6 relating to fundamental parental rights.</strong>
</p>



<p>You will need to call her office at (334) 242-7100 and leave a message asking her to stand with Alabama’s families by signing H.B. 6 into law immediately.</p>



<p>Your message should be in your own words, clearly mention H.B. 6, and express appreciation for her commitment to doing what is right for Alabama’s families. You might say something like the following:</p>



<p>
<em>Thank you for working to do what is right for Alabama’s families. Right now, would you please stand with us by signing H.B. 6 into law immediately? This bill will preserve and protect the proper level of respect for parental rights in our state. Thank you.</em>
</p>



<p>Once you have called, <strong>please forward this email to any friends and family you have in Alabama and encourage them to make a call, as well.</strong>
</p>



<p>Together we can protect children by empowering parents through this excellent addition to Alabama’s laws.</p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>



<p>Michael Ramey</p>

<![CDATA[<p>We are excited to let you know that <strong>the Louisiana House of Representatives is scheduled to vote on </strong>
<a href="http://www.legis.la.gov/legis/BillInfo.aspx?i=244010" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
<strong>H.B. 152</strong>
</a>
<strong>, a proposed parental rights amendment to the Louisiana Constitution, <em>tomorrow</em> (Tuesday) when they come into session at 1 PM.</strong>
</p>



<p>This powerful amendment, introduced by <a href="https://house.louisiana.gov/H_Reps/members?ID=51" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">State Representative Beryl Amedee</a>, will enshrine parental rights into the Louisiana Constitution for generations to come. </p>



<p>
<strong>Please </strong>
<a href="https://house.louisiana.gov/H_Reps/H_Reps_FullInfo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
<strong>call and email</strong>
</a>
<strong> your Louisiana state representative</strong> and ask him or her to stand with families and support H.B. 152. Your message can be as simple as the following:</p>



<p>
<em>“Please stand with families in Louisiana and vote for H.B. 152 to protect parental rights in the text of the Louisiana Constitution. This powerful amendment will protect parental rights in Louisiana for generations to come.”</em>
</p>



<p>While the U.S. Supreme Court has protected parental rights as fundamental for the past 100 years (you can read our recent <a href="https://parentalrightsfoundation.org/foote-v-ludlow/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
<em>amicus curiae</em> brief</a> to the First Circuit Court of Appeals laying out this history), <strong>it is imperative that we put this language into the Louisiana Constitution to make sure that future courts do not weaken parental rights.</strong> You can find more helpful resources about why this language is so important <a href="https://parentalrightsfoundation.org/fundamental-parental-rights/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. </p>



<p>I was privileged to testify in support of H.B. 152 on Monday, May 8, when it was heard in committee, and we were thrilled when it was <em>unanimously</em> voted out of Committee. You can also read the <a href="blank" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">written testimony</a> submitted by one of our board members, Professor William Wagner. (Feel free to include a link to this testimony when you email your representative.)  </p>



<p>Then, <strong>please forward this email to a couple of friends and family in Louisiana and ask them to also contact their representatives</strong> and ask them to support H.B. 152. Together, we can protect families in Louisiana for generations to come!</p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>



<p>Will Estrada</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Three weeks ago, we took our board members and volunteer state leaders into DC to educate members of Congress on the importance of protecting parental rights with the Parental Rights Amendment to the US Constitution, which US Representative Debbie Lesko (AZ-08) recently reintroduced as House Joint Resolution 38 (<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-joint-resolution/38?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22HJRes+38%22%5D%7D&amp;s=1&amp;r=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
<strong>H.J. Res. 38</strong>
</a>).</p>



<p>Since then, Congress has been away on recess, but now they have returned to DC!</p>



<p>And that means <strong>it’s time to call or email your US Representative and urge him or her to sign on as a cosponsor of the Parental Rights Amendment.</strong>
</p>



<p>Hopefully, many of those we visited have already decided to sign on; they just need a timely reminder to do so, now that their recess is behind them.</p>



<p>Still other lawmakers need to be persuaded—and your contact could be just the ticket.</p>



<p>You can find your lawmaker’s contact information at <a href="http://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative</a> or by calling the Capitol Switchboard at 202-224-3121.</p>



<p>Your message to Congress should be in your own words, but it can be as simple as the following:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>I am a constituent, and I’m calling to urge my congressman/congresswoman to cosponsor H.J. Res. 38, the Parental Rights Amendment. The primary role of parents in the upbringing of their children must be protected from the erosion of increasing government overreach. This Amendment will enshrine in the Constitution the very standard of parental rights protection that the Supreme Court has held for the last century, so that these rights will be secured for the next century and beyond. To sign on, simply reach out to Annie Clark in Debbie Lesko’s office. Thank you.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The Parental Rights Amendment, which would provide that “the liberty of parents to direct the upbringing, education, and care of their children is a fundamental right” and that this right is to be protected in the courts by strict judicial scrutiny, was introduced in the US House of Representatives in March. <strong>Adding to the seven cosponsors the resolution has now will increase the chances of securing a House subcommittee hearing, which will advance the discussion of these rights, raise the Amendment’s profile in Congress, and help us to get additional support.</strong>
</p>



<p>You can read more about the Amendment at <a href="http://ParentalRights.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ParentalRights.org</a>.</p>



<p>
<strong>Once you’ve called or emailed, please share this email with friends and family who might also make a call.</strong> Together we can amplify our voice in support of the vital parent-child relationship upon which our society is built.</p>



<p>Thank you for standing with us to protect children by empowering parents through the Parental Rights Amendment!</p>

<![CDATA[<p>We’re excited to let you know that yesterday, April 12, the Alabama House Judiciary Committee favorably reported House Bill 6 (<a href="https://www.legislature.state.al.us/pdf/SearchableInstruments/2023RS/BAXKJQ-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">H.B. 6</a>), The Parental Rights Protection Act! This powerful bill, introduced by <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Kenneth_Paschal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Representative Kenneth Paschal</a>, will make Alabama the 16<sup>th</sup> state in the nation to protect parental rights as fundamental in state code. Constitutional law professor and Parental Rights Foundation board member William Wagner submitted written testimony in support of H.B. 6 to the House Judiciary Committee. You can read Professor Wagner’s written testimony here. </p>



<p>
<strong>Now the battle to protect children by empowering parents moves to the full Alabama House.</strong> H.B. 6 could come up for a vote on the House floor as early as Tuesday, April 18.</p>



<p>
<strong>Please call and email your Alabama state representative and ask him or her to stand with Alabama families and support H.B. 6.</strong> You can find contact information for your Alabama state representative by typing in your address <a href="https://alabama.maps.arcgis.com/apps/InformationLookup/index.html?appid=7edc0e327b6b4f128e0dd7492faeb61c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. </p>



<p>Your message can be as simple as the following:</p>



<p>
<em>As one of your constituents, I respectfully ask you to stand with Alabama families and vote in support of H.B. 6, the Parental Rights Protection Act. This bill will codify existing Supreme Court precedent and preserve Alabama’s families from unnecessary and harmful state overreach. This bill reflects the fundamental truth that the best way to protect children is by empowering parents. Thank you.</em>
</p>



<p>If you email your Alabama state representative, you can also include a link to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cqRWQa6e28&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">video we produced</a> about the importance of bills like H.B. 6, and a link to William Wagner’s written testimony <a href="https://parentalrightsfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2023-Ala-HB-6-Written-Testimony-of-Prof-Wm-Wagner-final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>



<p>Then, please do one more thing: <strong>forward this email to 2 or 3 (or more!) friends and family in Alabama and encourage them to make their voices heard in support of protecting parental rights in Alabama.</strong> Together, we can make Alabama the 16<sup>th</sup> state in the nation to preserve this fundamental right!</p>



<p>For liberty,</p>

                                    <![CDATA[<p>On March 17, 2023, the Oklahoma State Department of Education held an open forum to allow public comment on proposed rule changes that would expand parents’ rights to be notified regarding sex education materials, including gender identity or sexual orientation, and that would strengthen language against encouraging minors to hide information from their parents.  These rules also assign penalties to schools and school officials who violate these provisions of the Oklahoma Parents’ Bill of Rights.<br>
                                    <br>The proposed rule changes would specifically assign penalties when schools expose children to pornographic content and when schools hide information about a child and/or encourage the child to hide information from a parent.<br>
                                      <br>Tracey Montgomery, Oklahoma State Coordinator for ParentalRights.org, spoke on behalf of the rule changes.  (See <a href="https://okcfox.com/news/local/proposed-rules-direct-schools-to-disclose-student-identity-information-to-parents-oklahoma-ok-okla-state-department-education-ryan-walters-state-superintendent-tracey-montgomery-tyler-owens-gina-darby-erika-wright-rural-schools-woke-pronoun" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fox25’s coverage of the event here</a>.) Her testimony was as follows:<br>
                                        <br>“My name is Tracey Montgomery, and I am the Oklahoma State Coordinator for Parental Rights.Org.  I wrote the Parents’ Bill of Rights in Oklahoma.  My husband and I traveled the state for over 4 years, bringing awareness and educating parents on their fundamental rights.  I spent 3 years lobbying the legislature until the Parent’s Bill of Rights was passed by an overwhelming majority of both Democrats and Republicans.  Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle understood that loving parents are best equipped to direct the upbringing and education of their children.</p>
                                          
                                          
                                          
                                          <p>The courts have also understood that parents act in the best interest of their children.&amp;nbsp; The Supreme Court’s precedent of upholding parent rights as fundamental goes all the way back to the early 1920s.&amp;nbsp; They understand that parents’ rights do not stop at the school door.</p>
                                          
                                          
                                          
                                          <p>Parents have the moral and legal obligations to decide what is best for their child in all areas of life, and parents have to live with the consequences of those decisions.&amp;nbsp; If a parent allows their child to be exposed to something harmful then the parent and the child are the ones that must live with the consequences of that decision.&amp;nbsp; If the school allows a child to be exposed to something that is harmful or later proves to be harmful, who is it that lives with the consequences?&amp;nbsp; The parent and the child are the ones who live with the consequences, NOT THE SCHOOL.</p>
                                          
                                          
                                          
                                          <p>Parents cannot protect their child, nor can they help their child reach their full potential if they don’t have all of the information on their child, or if they don’t know all that [their child is] being exposed to or taught. I support this rule change because it gives parents the tools to be able to protect their child and reach their full potential.</p>
                                          
                                          
                                          
                                          <p>Children have the same fundamental rights as you and I, but parents hold those rights in trust and exercise them for their children.&amp;nbsp; If I attend a class in college and they show or discuss sexual content or pornography, I have the ability to get up and walk out, to choose not to see the content.&amp;nbsp; Our children, however, do not have that same ability in school unless parents exercise it for them.<br>
                                          <br>Parents are willing to work with schools, but we are not willing to surrender our God-given authority or rights to the school.<br>
                                            <br>I support these rule changes and I represent a multitude of parents across the state who support these rule changes also.”</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Maryland <a href="https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/mgawebsite/Legislation/Details/sb0566?ys=2023RS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SB566</a>, Family Law—Fundamental Parental Rights, is scheduled to be heard in the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee this Wednesday, March 15, at 1:00pm. <strong>Parental Rights Foundation president Will Estrada plans to be on hand to testify, but we also need your help.</strong>
</p>



<p>
<a href="https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/2023RS/bills/sb/sb0566f.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">This bill guarantees</a> that “[a] parent has the <strong>fundamental right to direct the upbringing, education, care, and welfare of the parent’s child</strong>” and that “[t]he State or a political subdivision of the state may not infringe [these rights] unless the State or political subdivision demonstrates…that the…infringement is (1) necessary to achieve a compelling government interest; (2) narrowly tailored to achieve the compelling government interests; and (3) the least restrictive means to achieve the compelling government interest.” </p>



<p>
<strong>This is a terrific bill that will require state actors to treat parental rights as the fundamental constitutional rights that they are,</strong> as recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court in a consistent string of cases dating back 100 years to <em>Meyer v. Nebraska</em> (1923).</p>



<p>HB666, the companion bill to SB566, was heard in the House Judiciary Committee on February 22 and is still awaiting further action by that committee.</p>



<p>Today, we are asking you to <a href="https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/mgawebsite/Members/District" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">contact your Maryland Senator</a> and <strong>urge support of SB566 in the Senate</strong>. If they are on the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, ask them to vote “Yes” on the bill in committee. If not, ask them to vote for the bill when it comes to the Senate floor.</p>



<p>Your message, which should be in your own words, can be as simple as this:</p>



<p>
<em>I am calling to ask my senator to support SB566, Fundamental Parental Rights. The vital role of a parent in the life of a child must be protected. It’s time for Maryland law to catch up with a hundred years of U.S. Supreme Court precedent and protect these rights with the respect they deserve. If my senator is on the Committee on Judicial Proceedings, I ask him or her to support SB566 at Wednesday’s hearing and to vote it out of committee.</em>
</p>



<p>If you email your lawmaker, you might include this link to our video explaining why this legislation is so important: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cqRWQa6e28" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cqRWQa6e28</a>
</p>



<p>We also invite as many as are able to <strong>attend the hearing in person Wednesday, March 15, at 1:00 pm in the East Miller Senate Building, Room 2, Annapolis</strong>. Our own Will Estrada will be present to testify in favor of the bill.</p>



<p>Thank you for standing with us to protect children by empowering parents through common sense legislation like SB566 in the Maryland legislature.</p>



<p>Sincerely, </p>



<p>Michael Ramey</p>



<p>Executive Director </p>

<a href="https://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/bill_status/billinfo.aspx?id=93&amp;inflect=2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">H.B. 10, the Parents’ Bill of Rights</a>, will have a hearing in the New Hampshire House Children and Family Law Committee tomorrow, Tuesday, March 7, at 1:15 PM, in the Legislative Office Building (LOB), Rooms 206-208.</p>



<p>This powerful bill will establish parental rights as fundamental in New Hampshire, as well as provide parents and children with additional protections from government encroachment.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Please contact the legislators on the Children and Family Law Committee by <a href="https://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/house/committees/committeedetails.aspx?id=24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clicking this link</a>, and then clicking “Email All Committee Members.” </p>



<p>Your message can be as simple as the following:</p>



<p>
<em>“As a New Hampshire voter, I respectfully ask you to support H.B. 10, the Parents’ Bill of Rights. The vital role of a parent in the life of a child must be protected. It’s time for New Hampshire law to catch up with a hundred years of U.S. Supreme Court precedent and protect these rights with the respect they deserve. 15 states have already passed similar laws to establish parental rights as fundamental, and New Hampshire should be the 16</em>
<em>
<sup>th</sup>
</em>
<em> state to do so.”</em>
</p>



<p>In addition, you may want to include in your email the link to a letter we sent to the sponsors of H.B. 10 explaining why the Parents’ Bill of Rights is so important. </p>



<p>If you are able to go to Concord to testify in support of H.B. 10 in person, that would also be extremely powerful.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>To find out why H.B. 10 is so important, you can watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cqRWQa6e28" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this short video</a> from our organization. </p>



<p>You may remember that a bill very similar to H.B. 10 was narrowly defeated last year in the New Hampshire legislature. We must work together to ensure that does not happen again this year. Please email the Committee members, and then please forward this email to as many friends and family in New Hampshire as you can.</p>



<p>Thank you for standing with us to protect children by empowering parents.</p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>



<p>Will Estrada</p>

<![CDATA[<p>We are excited to let you know that Texas Representative James Frank has introduced <a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/88R/billtext/pdf/HJ00058I.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">House Joint Resolution 58 (HJR 58)</a> proposing a Parental Rights Amendment to the Texas Constitution.</p>



<p>If the resolution passes, the amendment will be proposed to the voters and subject to their approval at the November 7, 2023, election.</p>



<p>The amendment would take existing United States Supreme Court precedent and place it in the black-and-white text of the Texas Constitution, where it cannot be altered by the shifting attitudes of the courts. While Texas already protects parental rights in state code (<a href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/FA/pdf/FA.151.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Texas Family Code § 151.003</a>), protecting parental rights in the Texas Constitution will make this even more secure. </p>



<p>Below is the text of the proposed constitutional amendment in its entirety. (The bill includes other language in addition to this, which addresses how the amendment is to be proposed, voted on, and so forth.)</p>



<p>
<strong>Proposed Amendment Text</strong>
</p>



<p>Sec. 36, FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS OF PARENTS TO RAISE CHILDREN. (a) The liberty of a parent to direct the upbringing of a parent’s child is a fundamental right. This right includes the right to direct the care, custody, control, education, moral and religious training, and medical care of the child.</p>



<p>(b) The state or a political subdivision of this state shall not interfere with the rights of a parent described by subsection (a) unless the interference is:</p>



<p>(1) essential to further a compelling governmental interest; and&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>(2) narrowly tailored to accomplish that compelling governmental interest.</p>



<p>
<strong>Take Action Now</strong>
</p>



<p>Please take a moment now to <a href="https://wrm.capitol.texas.gov/home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">contact your state lawmakers</a> and urge them to protect your family by voting in favor of HJR 58 proposing a Parental Rights Amendment to the Texas Constitution. Your message should be in your own words, but can follow the example below:</p>



<p>
<em>I am a constituent, and I am urging my [representative/senator] to protect my family by supporting HJR 58, the Parental Rights Amendment. This amendment would take existing commonsense court protections for parental rights and put them in the black-and-white of the Texas Constitution. This will protect our rights from shifting court ideologies and preserve our families for generations. My family means the world to me, so I hope we can count on my lawmaker’s support of this vital bill.</em>
</p>



<p>Once you have made contact yourself, could you also forward this email to family and friends who are as concerned for their families as you are?</p>



<p>Thank you for making your voice heard to protect parental rights in the Lone Star State!</p>



<p>Sincerely yours,</p>



<p>Will Estrada</p>

<a href="https://nebraskalegislature.gov/FloorDocs/108/PDF/Intro/LB42.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">L.B. 42</a>, that protects innocent families from being caught up in child neglect investigations, has been schedule for a <strong>hearing in the Judiciary Committee </strong>
<strong>
<em>this Wednesday</em>
</strong>
<strong>, February 22</strong>.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>This commonsense language unanimously passed the Colorado legislature last year and was signed into law, and the same language is poised to become law (again unanimously) in the Commonwealth of Virginia this year.</p>



<p>Please&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://nebraskalegislature.gov/senators/senator_find.php" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">contact your senator</a>and ask <strong>him or her to cosponsor and vote in support of L.B. 42</strong>. You can call or email your senator (or both!) with a message as simple as the following:</p>



<p>
<em>“Please support L.B. 42. At a time when it seems that government is encroaching more and more on loving parents and their ability to care for and raise their children, L.B. 42 provides freedom to parents to let their children grow and thrive, freeing Nebraska’s Division of Children and Family Services to focus attention on children who are truly in danger of abuse or neglect.”</em>
</p>



<p>If you decide to email your senator, feel free to link to the&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://parentalrightsfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ParentalRights.org-letter-in-support-of-NE-LB-42-Reasonable-Independence-for-Kids.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">l</a>

<p>For background, L.B. 42 amends Nebraska law to clarify that a parent who allows his or her child to engage in “independent activities” will not be considered to have neglected the child, unless there is evidence of obvious danger that any reasonable parent would not – and should not — ignore.</p>

<p>
<strong>L.B. 42 enjoys broad bipartisan support from advocacy groups across the political spectrum</strong>, including ParentalRights.org, the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) (whose model bill Nebraska’s legislation mirrors), Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA), Americans for Prosperity (AFP), Nebraska Appleseed, 50Can, Let Grow, and several Nebraska-based child advocacy groups.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>S.B. 1367 amends Virginia law to clarify that a loving and caring parent who allows his or her child to engage in “independent activities” will not be considered to have neglected the child.</p>



<p>S.B. 1367 enjoys broad bipartisan support from advocacy groups across the political spectrum, including ParentalRights.org and the Parental Rights Foundation, the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) (whose model bill Virginia’s legislation mirrors), Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA), Let Grow, Virginia Poverty Law Center (VPLC), Independent Women’s Forum, and more.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Last month, our president, Will Estrada, joined with parents and advocates from across the political spectrum in testifying in support of S.B. 1367 when it was pending before the Virginia Senate.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>On Monday, S.B. 1367 faced a critical vote in the House of Delegates’ Courts of Justice subcommittee. Will Estrada again joined with other advocates in testifying in support, and it successfully passed out of subcommittee in a unanimous vote. You can watch Will’s testimony and the committee vote <a href="https://sg001-harmony.sliq.net/00304/harmony/en/PowerBrowser/PowerBrowserV2/20230213/-1/16975?startposition=20230213143247&amp;mediaEndTime=20230213145503&amp;viewMode=2&amp;globalStreamId=4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. (S.B. 1367 is discussed from timestamp 2:32:47 to 2:54:33.) S.B. 1367 is now pending before the full Courts of Justice committee. If it passes there, it goes to the full House of Delegates, and then to Governor Glenn Youngkin to be signed into law.</p>



<p>Please contact <a href="https://whosmy.virginiageneralassembly.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">your Virginia delegate</a> and ask him or her to support S.B. 1367. You can call or email (or both!) your Delegate with a message as simple as the following:</p>



<p>“Please support S.B. 1367 to provide children with reasonable independence. At a time when it seems that government is encroaching more and more on loving parents and their ability to care for and raise their children, S.B. 1367 provides freedom to parents to let their children grow and thrive, freeing Virginia’s Department of Social Services to focus attention on children who are truly in danger of abuse or neglect. This bill passed unanimously out of the Virginia Senate and the House of Delegates subcommittee and should become law in Virginia.”</p>



<p>If you decide to email your Virginia Delegate, please <a href="https://parentalrightsfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Parental-Rights-Foundation-Letter-of-Support-for-SB-1367-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">link to the letter</a> that we sent to the Senators Jill Vogel and Jennifer Boysko in support of S.B. 1367.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>On January 27, WV <a href="https://www.wvlegislature.gov/House/lawmaker.cfm?member=Delegate%20Butler" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Delegate Jim Butler</a> introduced <a href="https://www.wvlegislature.gov/bill_status/bills_history.cfm?INPUT=3118&amp;year=2023&amp;sessiontype=RS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HB3118</a>, Creating the Parents’ Bill of Rights. <a href="https://www.wvlegislature.gov/Bill_Text_HTML/2023_SESSIONS/RS/bills/hb3118%20intr.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The bill provides</a> that “[t]he liberty of a parent to direct the upbringing, education, and care, including medical care, of the parent’s child is a fundamental right.” It also requires the government to “demonstrate[e] that the governmental interest as applied to the parent and the child is of the highest order and long recognized in the history and traditions of this state, is narrowly tailored, and is not otherwise served by a less restrictive means.”</p>



<p>
<strong>This is a terrific bill that will require that parental rights be treated as the fundamental constitutional rights that they are,</strong> as recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court in a consistent string of cases dating back 100 years to <em>Meyer v. Nebraska</em> (1923).</p>



<p>On February 10, HB 3118 passed the House Committee on Senior, Children, and Family Issues and was then assigned to the Judiciary Committee, where we are hearing it may face opposition.</p>



<p>Today, we are asking you to <a href="https://www.wvlegislature.gov/House/roster.cfm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">contact your member of the West Virginia House</a> of Delegates and <strong>ask them to support HB3118</strong>. If they are on the House Judiciary Committee, ask them to call for a hearing and to vote the bill out of committee. If not, ask them to vote for the bill when it comes to the House floor.</p>



<p>Your message, which should be in your own words, can be as simple as this:</p>



<p>
<em>I am calling to ask my delegate to support HB3118 Creating a Parents’ Bill of Rights. The vital role of a parent in the life of a child must be protected. It’s time for West Virginia law to catch up with a hundred years of U.S. Supreme Court precedent and protect these rights with the respect they deserve. (If my delegate is on the Judiciary Committee, I ask him or her to call for a hearing on HB3118 and to vote it out of committee.)</em>
</p>



<p>
<strong>Please also email the House Judiciary Chairman, Del. </strong>
<a href="mailto:moore.capito@wvhouse.gov" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
<strong>Moore Capito</strong>
</a>
<strong>, and vice-chairman, </strong>
<a href="mailto:tom.fast@wvhouse.gov" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
<strong>Del. Tom Fast</strong>
</a>, and ask them to schedule HB 3118 for a hearing. These men control the committee’s schedule, and they need to hear from you!</p>



<p>If you email your lawmaker, you might include this link to our video explaining why this legislation is so important: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cqRWQa6e28</p>



<p>Thank you for standing with us to protect children by empowering parents through common sense legislation like HB3118 in the West Virginia House.</p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>



<p>Will Estrada<br>President</p>

<strong>Maryland Senate Bill 387</strong>
</a>
<strong>, introduced by Senator Kagan and assigned to the Finance Committee, would essentially do away with <em>any age of consent</em> for vaccination,</strong> depending solely on the opinion of a health care provider.</p>



<p>Ostensibly, the bill lowers the age of vaccination consent to 14 years, which is bad enough. Allowing a 14-year-old to consent without a parent’s knowledge, input, or support will open the door for peer pressure and coercion, rather than wisdom, caution, and knowledge of one’s family medical history, to drive children’s health decisions.</p>



<p>
<strong>But, the bill also provides that “a minor </strong>
<strong>
<em>under the age of 14 years</em>
</strong>
<strong>…has the capacity to consent to vaccination if…in the opinion of the health care provider, the minor is of sufficient intelligence to understand and appreciate the need for, nature of, and the significant risks and&amp;nbsp; consequences of the vaccination; and the minor is able to give informed consent” (emphasis added).</strong>
</p>



<p>Apparently, Senator Kagan is not familiar with <a href="https://parentalrightsfoundation.org/dc-minor-consent-case/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
<em>Booth and Mazer, et al, v Bowser</em>
</a>, the case we argued (and won) last year that threw out DC’s Minor Consent for Vaccinations Act Amendment of 2020 which tried to do this very same thing. <strong>The court sided with our clients because DC’s statute violated federal law and the fundamental rights of parents.</strong>
</p>



<p>This Maryland bill makes the very same fatal mistakes and must therefore be voted down.</p>



<p>
<strong>Take Action Now</strong>
</p>



<p>Please take a moment today to contact your Maryland state senator and urge them to vote “No” to SB 378, that violates federal law and constitutional parental rights. You can find your lawmaker’s <a href="https://msa.maryland.gov/msa/mdmanual/07leg/html/gaco.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">contact information here</a>.</p>



<p>Your message can be as simple as the following, preferably in your own words:</p>



<p>SB 378 is a bad idea for children. It would violate federal laws designed to protect children from coercion, and it would violate a parent’s constitutionally protected right to make decisions with and for their child for the child’s best interests. Cutting parents out of a minor’s healthcare is always a bad decision, and in this case we already know the law cannot survive a court challenge. Please protect our children by voting “no” on this terribly unwise legislation.</p>



<p>
<strong>Regardless of where one stands on vaccines, removing parents from major decisions in a child’s life is certain to have negative consequences.</strong> The Supreme Court of the United States has upheld the vital role that parents play in making these decisions which children, by virtue of simply being children, are not yet ready to make.</p>



<p>S.B. 378 treats children as adults.<strong>&amp;nbsp;</strong>A minor child may not know his or her medical history. A minor child may consent to an immunization, and then suffer an adverse reaction, and <strong>a parent who does not know that the child was immunized may miss warning signs and be unable to get the child to the hospital in time.</strong> A parent who does not know that their child received an immunization at school may have their family pediatrician administer the same immunization, resulting in potential harm due to multiple and unnecessary doses.</p>



<p>Thank you for standing with us to protect all Maryland children by halting this very dangerous bill.</p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>



<p>Will Estrada<br>President</p>

<![CDATA[<p>We need your calls and emails TODAY to ensure that <a href="http://billstatus.ls.state.ms.us/documents/2023/pdf/HB/1400-1499/HB1489IN.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">H.B. 1489, The Families’ Rights and Responsibilities Act,</a> does not die in committee.</p>



<p>This is a powerful bill that codifies in Mississippi law that parental rights are fundamental. In addition, it provides a host of strong protections to parents of Mississippi children, particularly those who are enrolled in public schools. If H.B. 1489 becomes law, Mississippi will be the 16<sup>th</sup> state in the nation to protect parental rights as fundamental.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, powerful special interests are trying to kill this bill. If H.B. 1489 does not go through the committee process TODAY, January 31, it will die.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Please <a href="http://www.legislature.ms.gov/legislators/representatives/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">call and email your Mississippi State Representative</a> right now and respectfully, but firmly, ask him or her to support H.B. 1489. Your message can be as simple as the following:</p>



<p>
<em>“I ask that you support H.B. 1489 and make sure that it does not die in committee today. This critical and timely bill will enshrine into Mississippi law that parental rights are a fundamental right, as the U.S. Supreme Court has held for the past 100 years. 15 states have already done this – it is time for Mississippi to become the 16th state to protect parental rights as fundamental in state law. Additionally, H.B. 1489 will protect parents and children in Mississippi’s public schools, allowing parents to make critical decisions regarding their own children. As parental rights are under attack, please stand with Mississippi parents and kids and support H.B. 1489, the Parents’ Bill of Rights.”</em>
</p>



<p>Thank you for standing with us to protect parental rights in Mississippi!</p>

<strong>We need your help TODAY to pass </strong>

<strong>SB 181</strong>
</a>
<strong>,</strong> a good bill to require notice of parental legal rights in child and family services cases. SB 181 has been introduced by <a href="https://leg.mt.gov/legislator-information/roster/individual/20231/15249" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Senator Dennis Lenz</a>, and will provide numerous Constitutional due process protections to families when Montana Department of Child and Family Services investigators are conducting an investigation regarding abuse or neglect allegations.</p>



<p>SB 181 is based on our <a href="https://parentalrightsfoundation.org/child-protection-investigations-reform-act/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">model bill</a>. It passed out of the Senate Public Health, Welfare and Safety Committee on January 26, by a vote of 8-1. </p>



<p>
<strong>“SB 181 is scheduled for a vote on the Montana Senate floor today, around 1 PM.”</strong> (Please note that schedules and timing can always change).&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>
<strong>Please call or email your Montana State Senator RIGHT NOW</strong> using this <a href="https://leg.mt.gov/map/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Find My Legislator tool</a>. </p>



<p>Your message can be as simple as the following:</p>



<p>
<em>“I urge you to support SB 181, which will add several due process protections into Montana law to protect the rights of innocent parents and caregivers when faced with a Child and Family Services investigation regarding alleged abuse or neglect, including notifying the family of their legal and constitutional rights during an investigation. These protections are required by the US and Montana Constitutions, and will serve to protect innocent families, while still allowing Child and Family Services investigators and law enforcement to protect children who are truly at risk of abuse or neglect.”</em>
</p>



<p>If you decide to send an email to your state legislator, you can include a link to an <em>amicus curiae</em> (“friend of the Court”) brief we submitted in a federal lawsuit several years ago that <strong>documents the harm that innocent families and children face when going through a child abuse or neglect investigation</strong>. SB 181 will provide needed protections in these types of investigations in order to protect innocent families. You can read our brief here: <a href="https://parentalrightsfoundation.org/doe-v-woodard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://parentalrightsfoundation.org/doe-v-woodard/</a> </p>



<p>Then, please forward this email to two or three friends, and ask them to also contact their Montana State Senator. Together, we CAN bring reform to the child welfare system in Montana.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Very truly yours,</p>

<p>S.B. 1367 enjoys broad bipartisan support from advocacy groups across the political spectrum, including ParentalRights.org and the Parental Rights Foundation, the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) (whose model bill Virginia’s legislation mirrors), Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA), Let Grow, Virginia Poverty Law Center (VPLC), Independent Women’s Forum, and more.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Please contact <a href="https://whosmy.virginiageneralassembly.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">your state senator</a> and ask him or her to support S.B. 1367. You can call or email (or both!) your senator with a message as simple as the following:</p>



<p>“Please support S.B. 1367 to provide children with reasonable independence. At a time when it seems that government is encroaching more and more on loving parents and their ability to care for and raise their children, S.B. 1367 provides freedom to parents to let their children grow and thrive, freeing Virginia’s Department of Social Services to focus attention on children who are truly in danger of abuse or neglect.”</p>



<p>If you decide to email your state senator, feel free to <a href="https://parentalrightsfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Parental-Rights-Foundation-Letter-of-Support-for-SB-1367-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">link to the letter</a> that we sent to the Senators Jill Vogel and Jennifer Boysko in support of S.B. 1367.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>I first heard from Kenneth Paschal in March of 2011, when he was the Birmingham chapter president of the Alabama Family Rights Association. He was trying to persuade state lawmakers to pass parental rights legislation, and we were happy to lend our support to his efforts.</p>



<p>Today, Kenneth Paschal is himself the state lawmaker, and he is still laser-focused on parental rights, as shown in a recent press release that his office sent out.</p>



<p>“Representative Paschal is championing the kind of solid parental rights protection we’d love to see passed in every state,” declared Parental Rights Foundation president Will Estrada. “I fully support House Bill 6 and urge the state lawmakers there to make this the reality in Alabama.”</p>



<p>The following is that press release from Rep. Kenneth Paschal of Alabama:</p>



<p>
<strong>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE </strong>
<strong>
<br>
</strong>
<strong>January 12, 2023</strong>
<strong>
<br>
</strong>
<strong>Contact: Kenneth&amp;nbsp;Paschal&amp;nbsp;(205)626-9458</strong>
</p>



<p>
<strong>STATE REP. KENNETH&amp;nbsp;PASCHAL&amp;nbsp;PRE-FILES LEGISLATION TO PROTECT PARENTAL RIGHTS AS “FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS”</strong>
</p>



<p>
<br>State Rep. Kenneth Paschal (R – Pelham) announced on Thursday he has pre-filed a pro-family bill that would add Alabama to the growing list of 15 states which have opted to preserve and protect parental rights as “fundamental rights” under statute.<br>
<br>Paschal’s legislation ensures that Alabama recognizes parental rights as “fundamental rights,” which cannot be taken away unless there is a “compelling reason” to do so, rather than “ordinary rights,” which allow parental decisions to be overridden by state government more easily.<br>
<br>“As a God-fearing man and father, I stand in unity with parents across Alabama who believe that it is our fundamental right to raise our children without fear of unwarranted government intrusion and interference,” Paschal said.  “Rather than creating additional rights, this bill simply preserves the rights already afforded to parents, who will be able to rest easy knowing that they won’t wake up one morning to find that the government is trying to erode their decision-making power in raising their children.”<br>
<br>Former NFL most valuable player and University of Alabama standout running back Shaun Alexander, who serves as vice president of the <a href="http://parentalrightsfoundation.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Parental Rights Foundation</a>, said Paschal’s measure is a much-needed step in shielding parental rights from being weakened and, in some cases, revoked by intrusive government edict.  Alexander’s statement read:<br>
<br>“I strongly support Rep. Paschal’s legislation that would enshrine in Alabama’s state code that the rights of parents are fundamental. While courts have long recognized these rights, it is time for the Alabama legislature to fully protect them by statute.<br>
<br>“One of life’s greatest honors is raising a child, which is a challenging task, a rewarding task, and, truth be told, a task that is key for the future of our great country. Few people will ever lead, provide, and protect a child like their parents.<br>
<br>“We must create the law that gives parents the authority to do that for their children. We must protect the family and the fundamental right to parent at the highest degree in the law. As a husband and father, I’m proud and honored to support this bill and urge that it be passed by the Alabama legislature and signed into law.”</p>



<p>(End Press Release) —</p>



<p>I encourage you to keep an eye on Rep. Paschal’s bill, HB 6, and <a href="https://alison.legislature.state.al.us/house-leaders-members" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">contact your own state representative</a> and ask them to support it when it comes before them for a vote. And be on the lookout for future alerts in case we need to urgently press lawmakers to push this bill through in Alabama.</p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>



<p>Michael Ramey<br>Executive Director</p>

<![CDATA[<p>We’re excited to let you know that Senator Ben Hansen (District 16) has introduced<a href="https://nebraskalegislature.gov/FloorDocs/108/PDF/Intro/LB42.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> L.B. 42</a>, a bill that protects innocent families from being caught up in child neglect investigations. </p>



<p>L.B. 42 was introduced January 5 and will be scheduled for a Judiciary Committee hearing, so we need your help. Please <a href="https://nebraskalegislature.gov/senators/senator_find.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">contact your senator</a> and ask him or her to cosponsor and vote in support of L.B. 42. You can call or email your senator (or both!) with a message as simple as the following:</p>



<p>
<em>“Please support L.B. 42. At a time when it seems that government is encroaching more and more on loving parents and their ability to care for and raise their children, L.B. 42 provides freedom to parents to let their children grow and thrive, freeing Nebraska’s Division of Children and Family Services to focus attention on children who are truly in danger of abuse or neglect.”</em>
</p>



<p>If you decide to email your senator, feel free to link to the letter of support that we sent to the sponsor of L.B. 42.</p>



<p>For background, L.B. 42 amends Nebraska law to clarify that a parent who allows his or her child to engage in “independent activities” will not be considered to have neglected the child, unless there is evidence of obvious danger that any reasonable parent would not – and should not — ignore. L.B. 42 enjoys broad bipartisan support from advocacy groups across the political spectrum, including ParentalRights.org, the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) (whose model bill Nebraska’s legislation mirrors), Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA), Americans for Prosperity (AFP), Nebraska Appleseed, 50Can, Let Grow, and several Nebraska-based child advocacy groups.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you for standing with us for parental rights and freedom.</p>

										<content:encoded>
<![CDATA[<p>We have been busy in Pennsylvania this year. With a lot of momentum behind us and a lot of opportunities ahead of us, we need your support to continue our vital efforts in your Commonwealth.</p>



<p>First, we worked with <strong>allies from across the political spectrum</strong> to oppose <a href="https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billInfo/billInfo.cfm?sYear=2021&amp;sInd=0&amp;body=H&amp;type=B&amp;bn=1737" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">House Bill 1737</a>, which would have allowed Child Welfare Services to ask a judge to force a drug test on any parent who was so much as accused of child neglect. No level of evidence, no probable cause would be necessary. <strong>A simple, anonymous phone call with an accusation would be enough to haul a family before a judge</strong>, threatening the sanctity of their home and the privacy of their children.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>To defeat this bill, we worked with partners as diverse as the <a href="https://www.womenslawproject.org/2022/01/14/urgent-stop-unconstitutional-targeting-of-parents-of-color-in-pennsylvania/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Women’s Law Project</a>, <a href="https://www.aclupa.org/en/legislation/hb-1737-compelled-drug-screening" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ACLU of Pennsylvania</a>,&amp;nbsp; the Home School Legal Defense Association, and Community Legal Services of Philadelphia to oppose its passage. So far, <strong>families in Pennsylvania remain safe from this level of intrusive overreach</strong>. You can read our letter of opposition <a href="https://parentalrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ParentalRights.org-Opposition-to-HB-1737-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>



<p>And we didn’t just play defense. <strong>We went on offense.</strong> We were proud to work with Senators Doug Mastriano, Kristin Phillips-Hill, Judy Ward, and Michele Brooks to draft and introduce Senate Bill 996, the Parental Rights Protection Act. <strong>We worked behind the scenes with Senate leadership to ensure that S.B. 996 was a priority,</strong> and when S.B. 996 had a committee hearing on October 18, Parental Rights Foundation President Will Estrada testified in support of the bill. You can read his testimony <a href="https://parentalrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Testimony-of-William-A-Estrada-in-Support-of-SB-996-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> and watch the full hearing <a href="https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/CMS/ArchiveDetails.cfm?SessYear=2021&amp;MeetingId=2508&amp;Code=41&amp;Chamber=S" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> (Will was the very last speaker to testify, at the very end of the hearing).</p>



<p>We were thrilled when the Senate State Government Committee passed S.B. 996 out of committee on Monday, October 24, by a 6–4 vote. We want to thank Senators Cris Dush, Daniel Laughlin, Doug Mastriano, Kristin Phillips-Hill, Patrick Stefano, and David Argall for standing with parents and voting “yes” on S.B. 996.</p>



<p>Although there will not be time to pass S.B. 996 out of the Pennsylvania Senate before the end of the session, this critical committee vote shows that the Pennsylvania Senate leadership stands with parents to ensure that the traditional, primary role of parents in the upbringing, education, and care of their children is protected in Pennsylvania law going into next year’s legislative session.</p>



<p>
<strong>Parental rights are winning in the Keystone State. But all of these projects take time, hard work, and financial resources.</strong>
</p>



<p>Would you be willing to stand with us and visit <a href="https://secure.parentalrights.org/np/clients/parentalrights/donation.jsp?campaign=3&amp;&amp;test=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ParentalRightsFoundation.org/donate</a> to make your best donation to invest in these continuing efforts? All donations are tax-deductible, and they will ensure that we are able to fight nationally and in Pennsylvania to protect parental rights.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>You know that <strong>those who want to control your children will not stop coming after you</strong>, your child’s greatest defense. And that is why we will not stop standing with you to defend your family.</p>



<p>So please take a moment today to support our efforts as you are able.</p>



<p>Thank you as always for standing with us and for your children.</p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>

<![CDATA[<p>We just received word that Pennsylvania&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billinfo/billinfo.cfm?syear=2021&amp;sInd=0&amp;body=S&amp;type=B&amp;bn=996" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Senate Bill 996</a>, the Parental Rights Protection Act, will be&amp;nbsp;<strong>up for a vote in the Senate State Government Committee on Monday</strong>&amp;nbsp;<strong>morning</strong>, October 24.</p>



<p>This doesn’t leave a lot of time to contact your senator on that committee and urge him or her to vote in favor of the bill to protect families like yours and mine.</p>



<p>Based on the model found at the Parental Rights Foundation website, SB 996 will&amp;nbsp;<strong>preserve the liberty of parents to direct the upbringing, education, and care of their children as a fundamental right</strong>. Further, it will enshrine that right in state law where it belongs—not just in state court precedent.</p>



<p>The rights guaranteed by SB 996 are those already preserved under the United States Constitution as recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court for nearly a hundred years. But enshrining these rights in Pennsylvania law will further protect them for families in the Keystone State.</p>



<p>This is the bill in favor of which Will Estrada testified at a committee hearing just last week, which you may have seen in our&amp;nbsp;<a href="blank" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">social media post</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Call to Action</h2>



<p>
<strong>Please take a moment right now to see if your senator is&amp;nbsp;</strong>

<strong>.</strong>
</p>



<p>Then, if they are,&amp;nbsp;<strong>urge them to vote</strong>&amp;nbsp;in favor of SB 996 on Monday. Be sure to mention that you are a constituent. As a voter in their district, you have a voice that carries extra weight!</p>



<p>
<strong>If your senator is not on the committee</strong>, contact them anyway and urge them to support the bill when it is reported out of committee for a full Senate vote.</p>



<p>Thank you for standing with us to protect children by empowering parents through good legislation in Pennsylvania!</p>

<![CDATA[<p>I am excited to announce the introduction of the Parental Rights Amendment to the US Constitution in Congress! In addition to our work across the nation to defend families and parental rights through litigation, state legislation, and other advocacy, we are pulling the Amendment off the back burner and ramping up a new effort in Congress led by Representative Debbie Lesko, a Congresswoman and mom of three from Arizona. I’m including our press release below, and after that a call to action.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>Parental Rights Amendment Introduced in Congress</strong>
</h2>



<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE // October 18, 2022 // Washington, DC – Rep. Debbie Lesko (R-AZ) today introduced in the US House of Representatives an amendment to the United States Constitution. The Amendment would enshrine the traditional liberty of parents to direct a child’s upbringing, education, and care as a fundamental right.</p>



<p>Lesko, who heads the Protect Kids Caucus in the House, believes protecting this traditional role of parents is key to keeping children healthy and safe. “Parental rights are under attack across our nation,” Lesko says. “I am pleased to have the support of ParentalRights.org in introducing this crucial amendment to the US Constitution to enshrine parents’ fundamental right to have a say in their children’s education, and I will continue to advocate for protecting children and empowering parents in Congress.”</p>



<p>Will Estrada, the president of ParentalRights.org and the Parental Rights Foundation, declared, “The Supreme Court has recognized parental rights for a century, but parental rights are just too important to be left to Supreme Court precedent alone. This Amendment will enshrine these traditional rights in the black-and-white of the Constitution, preserving that parental role for generations to come. We are honored to work with Rep. Lesko to protect children by making this Amendment a reality.”</p>



<p>“The Supreme Court in 1923 said ‘the child is not the mere creature of the State,’ but many of today’s bureaucrats have lost sight of that,” says Jim Mason, chairman of the board for the Parental Rights Foundation and ParentalRights.org. “This Amendment will permanently codify that precedent and restore a proper respect for the vital parent-child bond in America.”</p>



<p>The House joint resolution to introduce the Amendment will receive a bill number in the next couple of days. It marks the eighth straight Congress in which the Amendment has been introduced.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>Call to Action</strong>
</h2>



<p>Right now, you can <strong>promote the Parental Rights Amendment in Congress by encouraging your own US representative to sign on</strong> as a cosponsor to the resolution. Here’s how you can help:</p>



<p>1. Once it’s available, check the current list of cosponsors at Congress.gov to see if your representative is already a cosponsor. If not, proceed to step 2. <strong>(The list won’t be available for a few days. Until it is, you may assume your lawmaker is not on it and proceed to step 2.)</strong>
</p>



<p>
<strong>2. Find your representative’s </strong>
<a href="https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
<strong>contact information here</strong>
</a>
<strong>.</strong>
</p>



<p>
<strong>3. Email or call your representative’s office.</strong> Tell their staff that you are a constituent and that you are urging your member of Congress to contact Bobby Bravo in Rep. Debbie Lesko’s office to sign on as a cosponsor of the Parental Rights Amendment. (We’ll provide the bill number here as soon as we have it, too—that will help.)</p>



<p>
<strong>Your message can simply be something like this:</strong>
</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>I live in Rep. _____’s district, and I value the role of parents in the life of a child. I’m calling to urge my representative to contact Bobby Bravo in Rep. Debbie Lesko’s office and sign on as a cosponsor of the Parental Rights Amendment. Parents, not the government, have the fundamental right to decide what is best for their child. Please sign on to cosponsor this vital safeguard for my children and for America’s families.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>And that’s it!&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you for standing with us to promote the Parental Rights Amendment and empowering parents for the protection of their children!</p>

<![CDATA[<p>I’m just going to put this out there: <strong>our volunteers are some of the greatest human beings on the planet!</strong>
</p>



<p>A couple of weeks ago, ParentalRights.org president Will Estrada and I found ourselves in the same place as a few of our state coordinators and got to sit down with them. We talked (<em>in person!</em>) about our legislative efforts of the past year and how we’d like to proceed in 2023. We also discussed next steps in introducing the Parental Rights Amendment to the US Constitution in Congress.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>As exciting as that conversation was, though, what really struck me was just <strong>how blessed we are to get to work with such amazing people for the cause of parental rights.</strong>
</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>Parental Rights Champions</strong>
</h2>



<p>I’m talking about champions like Paulette Brack of Michigan, who first started working with nonprofits (and with our founding president, Michael Farris) in the 1980s—well before ParentalRights.org was founded in 2007!&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Or Barb Heki of Iowa, who has been leading the charge in her state for more than 10 years, and who is right now in the middle of negotiating with lawmakers the best way to bring a fundamental parental rights law to the Hawkeye State in 2023.</p>



<p>Or Jim and Patti Sullivan, who successfully steered a Parent’s Bill of Rights through Florida’s legislature in 2021 and yet are just getting started. (You can hear Patti talk about her experience in <a href="https://parentalrightsfoundation.org/parental-rights-in-florida-with-patti-sullivan-and-adriana-gonzales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this episode</a> of our <em>EPPiC Broadcast</em> podcast.)</p>



<p>In fact, getting to sit down with them was so encouraging, we’ve begun serious talks about hosting a training event for state leaders, hopefully in the coming months. It has been several years since our last one, and it’s time to “get the band back together.”</p>



<p>
<strong>But in all this, there is still something missing—and it might just be </strong>
<strong>
<em>you</em>
</strong>
<strong>.</strong>
</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>An Invitation</strong>
</h2>



<p>The reason that ParentalRights.org has been able to do so much good through the years is because of our<strong> passionate ParentalRights.org volunteers who do so much of the on-the-ground work to defend families, empower parents, and protect children.</strong> It is reader-supporters <em>just like you</em> who one day rise to the call and decide to see what they can do to bring parental rights protection to their state.</p>



<p>With the rise of many volunteer parent grassroots groups in the past two years, we have more organizations to partner with than ever before. And that creates opportunities for ParentalRights.org volunteers to coordinate with these partners and with lawmakers to make great strides for parental rights, wherever you happen to live.</p>



<p>
<strong>So here’s my invitation to you today:</strong> If you would be interested in pursuing parental rights efforts in your state (especially toward passing state legislation to protect families), send an email to <a href="mailto:Michael@parentalrights.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Michael@parentalrights.org</a> and put <strong>“2022 Volunteer”</strong> in the subject line. If your state already has a coordinator, I will connect you with them. And if not, we can talk about whether you might be the right person for that role.</p>



<p>(One word of caution: If you are in the middle of a family crisis right now, I will urge you to focus on your family and get that resolved first. We don’t want to take your energy away from that; it wouldn’t be the best thing for you, your family, or the organization.)</p>



<p>
<strong>There is something Paulette, Barb, Patti, and Jim all have in common: there was once a time when they had never done anything like this before.</strong> Just like you. But then they stepped up and volunteered. I honestly can’t imagine where ParentalRights.org would be today without them.</p>



<p>So, carefully consider if you’d like to join us, and send me an email to let me know. I look forward to hearing from you soon!</p>



<p>And if you don’t have the time to volunteer, perhaps you have the financial ability to help support our parent volunteers. You can <a href="http://parentalrights.org/donate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">contribute to ParentalRights.org</a> and our efforts to pass legislation. Or, make a tax-deductible <a href="http://parentalrightsfoundation.org/donate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">donation to the Parental Rights Foundation</a> to fund efforts like our in-person volunteer training event coming in the next few months.</p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>



<p>Michael Ramey</p>

<![CDATA[<p>With a nod to the country classic, “The Night the Lights Went out in Georgia,” now we are celebrating the day they came back on!</p>



<p>
<strong>On April 28, Georgia Governor Brian Kemp signed into law House Bill 1178, the Parents’ Bill of Rights, preserving the fundamental liberty of parents to direct their child’s education and care</strong>, and <em>shining a light</em> on what goes on in the public schools. This bill is based on our model legislation, and we were proud to support it.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>With the stroke of the governor’s pen, Georgia became the 15th state to preserve these rights in statutory law. (A majority of states recognize these rights in their courts but have not yet codified them in the legal code.)</p>



<p>Georgia’s new Parents’ Bill of Rights now fills at least two vital needs in Georgia law: First, it preserves “a fundamental right of parents to direct the upbringing and care of their minor children.” While courts across the country differ on the level of respect they afford to parental rights, their respect for fundamental rights is uniformly very high, demanding “strict scrutiny protection”: the strongest possible level of judicial review. So, this codifying of parental rights as <em>fundamental</em> leaves no room for ambiguity on the level of protection they are to receive in Georgia courts.</p>



<p>Second, it provides that <strong>“important information relating to a minor child should not be withheld, either inadvertently or purposefully, from his or her parent, including information relating to the minor child’s education.”</strong>
</p>



<p>While the quote above comes from the General Assembly’s “findings” and is not necessarily legally binding in itself, it is a good summary of what is laid out in detail (and in very legally binding fashion) throughout the rest of the law.</p>



<p>As you may imagine, <strong>national teacher unions and special interest groups fought this bill, calling it “anti-education.”</strong> But the only thing the law does is permit parents to see and know what their child is learning, what records are being kept on their child, and how their child is doing in school. If that is “anti-education,” they have a strange definition of “education.”</p>



<p>The law also reflects and preserves the freedom of parents, already constitutionally protected, to enroll their child in public, private (religious or secular), or homeschool programs.</p>



<p>In the words of Governor Kemp during the signing ceremony<strong>, “Making sure parents have the ultimate say in their child’s education should not be controversial.”</strong>
</p>



<p>But for special interest groups, it is. And the controversy arises on one point: they want parents kept in the dark about what their child is learning in the public schools.</p>



<p>And that’s exactly why we celebrate the lights going on in Georgia.</p>



<p>Last year, the fight was in Florida (where we also won!). And as that struggle wound down, Florida state Representative Erin Grall had this to say about similar parental rights legislation:&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>“Based upon the opposition to this bill, <strong>it is clear that liberties have been taken for too long with regard to accessing our children.</strong> The fact that any entity is concerned that their ‘right’ to access our children is being infringed upon makes the case for this legislation.”</p>



<p>Representative Grall was right in 2021, and, sadly, her point is even more clearly true today.</p>



<p>In New Hampshire, for example, this very year, another Parents’ Bill of Rights failed over this very issue. Nationwide teacher unions and special interest groups lobbied the legislature there because <strong>they opposed the idea that parents should know what is going on in their child’s life at school.</strong> They penned a letter warning lawmakers that providing information to parents about their own children in public schools would put children at risk. And, unfortunately, just a few too many of the lawmakers bought it.</p>



<p>The loss this year in New Hampshire is countered by the big win for parents in Georgia.&amp;nbsp; Parents and responsive lawmakers want to preserve parental rights because they understand that children are safer and experience better outcomes when parents are “in the loop” and are an active part of their child’s education.</p>



<p>But it won’t be an easy battle. <strong>Now more than ever, your continued support of our work is so vitally important.</strong>
</p>



<p>It is only with your partnership that we were able to push through to success in Florida in 2021 and to see this huge victory in Georgia earlier this year. And it is only with your <a href="https://secure.parentalrights.org/np/clients/parentalrights/donation.jsp?campaign=5&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">continued investment</a> that we will overcome the opposition in states like New Hampshire and Iowa, where similar measures have failed to cross the finish line (so far).</p>



<p>Now, there is more help on the way, too. A recent survey, just released by the Parental Rights Foundation, shows that <strong>support for parental rights remains high throughout the country.</strong> Which should tell New Hampshire lawmakers that they just made a big mistake.</p>



<p>I’ll unpack that survey more for you in a future letter.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>But for today, the take-away is this: <strong>states would do well to follow the lead of Georgia in protecting parental rights</strong>, and not the lead of New Hampshire. When 83 percent of the public support an issue (as our Parental Rights Foundation survey found), it shouldn’t really matter what the teacher unions or special interests say—not for a lawmaker who wants to keep his or her seat.</p>



<p>
<strong>We are on the winning team! But we still have so much work to do.</strong>
</p>



<p>Lawmakers from New Hampshire to Iowa to California need to know the results of this survey. And they need good models to follow, like the<a href="https://parentalrightsfoundation.org/fundamental-parental-rights/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> one we shared</a> at the American Legislative Exchange Council, which served as the basis for Georgia’s new law, to help them support families. They need us to show them how the law can protect children by empowering parents. And to get the word to them and to lobby legislators to stand with parents, we need your support.</p>



<p>So that you, too, can know just what I’m talking about, I will provide you with that model right here in this letter:</p>



<p>Section 1. The liberty interest of a parent in the nurture, education, care, custody, and control<sup> </sup>of the parent’s child is a fundamental right <em>recognized by the United States Constitution and the Constitution of the State of ____________.</em>
</p>



<p>Section 2. No agency or officer of this state nor any agency or officer of any subdivision of this state shall infringe fundamental parental rights except as provided by law narrowly tailored to meet a compelling governmental interest by the least restrictive means.</p>



<p>
<strong>It’s not complicated.</strong> <strong>Parents know what is best for their children.</strong> And they know that in order to act on that knowledge, they need their rights as parents to be protected. Because any infringement of those rights could one day lead to harm for their precious child.</p>



<p>You know that, too.</p>



<p>It’s why you have stood with us through the years, to pass laws in states like Oklahoma years ago and Georgia today. Together, we will bring good, solid laws to states like New Hampshire and Iowa—and the 33 other states that still need them—tomorrow, as well.</p>



<p>That’s why I am asking you to invest with us again today, to continue these efforts until every state has legal protection for parents, for the sake of our children.</p>



<p>Can I count on you today to <a href="https://secure.parentalrights.org/np/clients/parentalrights/donation.jsp?campaign=5&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">make your very best investment </a>of $10, $25, or even $125 to continue our vital state-level work?</p>



<p>I know many state legislatures are just winding down, and it may seem we have time before we gear up for 2023. But I can tell you we have already been contacted by lawmakers who saw the battles we have faced this year and are eager to get a jump on legislation for next year.</p>



<p>
<strong>The time to fight this battle is </strong>
<strong>
<em>right now</em>
</strong>
<strong>, before the other side gets any stronger, and while such an overwhelming majority of Americans are still on our side.</strong>
</p>



<p>So, please take a moment today to <a href="https://secure.parentalrights.org/np/clients/parentalrights/donation.jsp?campaign=5&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">make your best investment</a> in this worthy cause, to protect all children by protecting their parents’ rights.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Urgent action is needed to protect religious and medical vaccine exemptions in Massachusetts. An amendment has been snuck into an economic development bill that would <strong>severely curtail the ability of a family’s trusted pediatrician to issue medical exemptions and would allow public and private schools to ignore a family’s religious exemption.</strong>
</p>



<p>This amendment could be passed within the next few days. It is urgent that you <strong>contact your Massachusetts state legislators and urge them to remove the “Community Immunity Act”</strong> from <a href="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/192/S3030?sm_guid=NTE3NjY4fDYzNjA2NzcwfC0xfG1ob3l0QHBhdHJpb3Qtc3RyYXRlZ2llcy5jb218NTQyOTQwN3x8MHwwfDExODA2NDEwMHwxMDgxfDB8MHx8NTA3MzM5fDA1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Senate Amendment S.3030</a> to <a href="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/192/H5034/CommitteeVote?sm_guid=NTE3NjY1fDYzNTkzNDU4fC0xfGRlYm9yYWguY3VtYmVlQG1hZmFtaWx5Lm9yZ3w1NDI5MzY5fHwwfDB8MTE4MDY1MDQ1fDEwODF8MHwwfHw1MDczMzV8MA2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">House Bill H.5034</a>—lines 2943-3036 of Senate Amendment S.3030.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>You can reach your Massachusetts state senator and representative <a href="https://malegislature.gov/Search/FindMyLegislator" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. For your convenience, we are partnering with the <a href="https://www.mafamily.org/2022/07/28/religious-exemptions-under-attack/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Massachusetts Family Institute</a> and Health Choice 4 Action-MA, who graciously allowed us to link to their <strong>online action alert </strong>
<a href="https://p2a.co/iYqOeZQ?sm_guid=NTE3NjYwfDYzNTkzNDU4fC0xfGRlYm9yYWguY3VtYmVlQG1hZmFtaWx5Lm9yZ3w1NDI5MzIzfHwwfDB8MTE4MDY0MTg3fDEwODF8MHwwfHw1MDczMzB8MA2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
<strong>here</strong>
</a>
<strong>.</strong>
</p>



<p>
<strong>We believe that decisions related to childhood vaccines should be up to parents, not government bureaucrats.</strong> And we believe that any legislation that makes it harder for parents to exercise their fundamental right as parents and choose to delay vaccines or exempt their children from vaccine mandates should be rejected. That is why we are opposing this amendment.</p>



<p>Thank you for standing with us to defend parental rights.</p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>



<p>Will Estrada</p>

<![CDATA[<p>We have been <a href="https://parentalrights.org/heres-what-were-up-against/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">updating you</a> about a bill that threatens parental rights, <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220SB866" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Senate Bill 866</a>.</p>



<p>On June 16, due to the concerns raised by hundreds of thousands of California parents, grandparents, and concerned citizens like you, <strong>the California Assembly amended SB 866 to raise the age of children who can “consent” to vaccines without parental involvement from 12 to 15</strong>.</p>



<p>This is a major development for three reasons. First, there is a significant difference in maturity between a 12-year-old and a 15-year-old. At the very least, this amendment takes 12-, 13-, and 14-year-olds “off the table.” Second, <strong>this is the first real sign that passage of the bill may not be guaranteed.</strong> Third, this shows that supporters of SB 866 realize after the <a href="https://parentalrightsfoundation.org/district-court-grants-injunction-against-dc-minor-consent-act/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Parental Rights Foundation’s recent win</a> in federal court against a similar law in the District of Columbia that SB 866 is on shaky legal grounds.</p>



<p>Despite this amendment, one important problem remains: a 15-year-old is not an 18-year-old. A 15-year-old, while more mature than a 12-year-old, is still a child, both in the eyes of the law and in simple maturity.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>And that’s why we ask that you <strong>continue to call your legislators</strong> and share your thoughts on SB 866 with them.</p>



<p>
<strong>Take Action</strong>
</p>



<p>You can <a href="https://findyourrep.legislature.ca.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">call or email your Assemblyman</a> and share your thoughts about the amended version of SB 866 with him or her. Because this bill can come for a vote literally at any moment, there is no time to delay!</p>



<p>
<strong>Background and Talking Points</strong>
</p>



<p>SB 866, Vaccine Consent for Minors, as amended, allows 15-year-olds to consent to vaccinations without a parent’s input, knowledge, or support. It will open the door for peer pressure and coercion, rather than wisdom, caution, and knowledge of one’s family medical history, to drive children’s health.</p>



<p>Introduced in the Senate by Senators Pan and Wiener, the bill has already passed the California Senate. If it passes the Assembly, it will go to Governor Newsom’s desk.</p>



<p>Regardless of where one stands on vaccines, <strong>removing parents from major decisions in a child’s life is certain to have negative consequences.</strong> The Supreme Court of the United States has upheld the vital role that parents play in making these decisions which children, by virtue of simply being children, are not yet ready to make.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>S.B. 866 treats children as adults.<strong>&amp;nbsp;</strong>A minor child may not know his or her medical history. A minor child may consent to an immunization, and then suffer an adverse reaction, and <strong>a parent who does not know that the child was immunized may miss warning signs and be unable to get the child to the hospital in time.</strong> A parent who does not know that their child received an immunization at school may have their family pediatrician administer the same immunization, resulting in potential harm due to multiple and unnecessary doses.</p>



<p>
<strong>Thank you for standing with us to protect children by empowering parents in California.</strong> We should be heartened by this recent amendment to SB 866 and redouble our efforts to protect children by preserving parental rights in California.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<![CDATA[<p>As you read this email, parents in California are in the fight of their life to protect their children and to defend parental rights. You see, a dangerous bill, <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220SB866" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Senate Bill 866,</a> may come up for a vote at any time in the California Assembly—its final hurdle in the legislature, as it already passed the California Senate.</p>



<p>
<strong>S.B. 866, Vaccine Consent for Minors, would force California children as young as 12 to make major medical decisions without a parent’s input, knowledge, or support.</strong> It will open the door for peer pressure and coercion, rather than wisdom, caution, and knowledge of one’s family medical history, to drive children’s health.</p>



<p>If you live in California, you know the stakes, and have seen our action alerts and online advertising campaign against this bill. But if you live in one of the other 49 states (or a territory), I’d ask you to continue reading, because <strong>some of your own state’s elected officials likely share the philosophy behind this California bill.</strong>
</p>



<p>At ParentalRights.org, we’re not against childhood immunizations. We have a simple, yet powerful, belief: you, the parent, who know and love your child the best, should make those decisions. Not me. Not elected officials. And certainly not unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>They’re Not Alone</strong>
</h2>



<p>California is not alone in trying to remove parents from the primary role of caring for their children. In 2020, the District of Columbia’s Council passed the Minor Consent to Vaccination Act Amendment of 2020, a bill that not only forced children as young as 11 to make decisions regarding vaccination without parental input, knowledge, or support, but also <em>mandated </em>that parents be kept in the dark. Our legal and charitable arm, the Parental Rights Foundation, filed suit against DC’s Minor Consent Act, and on March 18, 2022, <a href="https://parentalrightsfoundation.org/district-court-grants-injunction-against-dc-minor-consent-act/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a federal district court judge issued a preliminary injunction</a> against the act. For the time being, parental rights have been preserved in the District of Columbia.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>
<strong>Opponents of parental rights would like nothing more than to try to pass similar legislation in your state and replicate the attacks we’re seeing in California and the District of Columbia</strong>. It’s only your dedication to your fundamental right as parents to raise your children that has kept this from already happening elsewhere.</p>



<p>In California, we are conducting a major campaign to try to stop S.B. 866. We (and numerous other allied organizations) are urging concerned parents to call their state elected officials. We’re spending money on digital advertising to try to reach more concerned parents. If the legislature ignores California parents and passes S.B. 866, we’ll urge California Governor Gavin Newsom to veto this bill. And if all levels of California’s elected officials ignore parents, their constituents, and our constitutional rights and make S.B. 866 law in California, we will file a federal lawsuit on behalf of parents, just as we did against the District of Columbia.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>The Battle to Protect Children</strong>
</h2>



<p>All of this is expensive. We know that now is not a good time to ask for money, given the financial and economic hardships facing so many of us. We understand if you are unable to support us financially right now. <strong>Your family comes first.</strong>&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>But if you do have the ability to help us fight for parental rights in California and elsewhere, <a href="http://parentalrights.org/donate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
<strong>we ask for your support.</strong>
</a> We promise to use your money wisely and carefully. We believe that this fight against S.B. 866 is important enough. And that’s why we’re in this battle.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Laws removing parents from their children’s health care decisions, whether for vaccines or any other treatment, force children to make adult decisions, whether they’re ready or not (and most are not). <strong>Parents, not young children, should decide health care decisions, such as vaccine administration.</strong> A minor child may not know his or her medical history. A minor child may consent to an immunization, and then suffer an adverse reaction, and a parent who does not know that the child was immunized may miss warning signs and be unable to get the child to the hospital in time. Or a parent may not know that their child received an immunization at school, and have their family pediatrician administer the same immunization, resulting in potential harm due to multiple and unnecessary doses.</p>



<p>The Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., said, <strong>“Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.”</strong> And an attack on parental rights—whether by the DC Council or the California legislature—is a threat to our sacred right as parents.</p>



<p>Thank you for standing with us in this nationwide fight to protect our children by empowering parents.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>



<p>Will Estrada</p>

<![CDATA[<p>We wanted to let you know that the Senate State Government Committee has postponed today’s 12:30 PM vote on <a href="https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billinfo/billinfo.cfm?syear=2021&amp;sind=0&amp;body=S&amp;type=B&amp;bn=0996" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">S.B. 996</a>, <strong>the Parental Rights Protection Act.</strong>
</p>



<p>While we are disappointed about this development, we are hopeful that this is just a temporary pause. We continue to talk with senators and their staff. We will let you know immediately as soon as S.B. 996 is scheduled for a vote.</p>



<p>We wanted to let you know immediately, as we had heard that many of you were planning on attending the vote today at the Pennsylvania Capitol.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>During this pause, we encourage you to continue to call your Pennsylvania legislators and urge them to support S.B. 996 to strengthening the right of parents to direct the education, upbringing, and care of their children.</p>



<p>
<strong>Background</strong>
</p>



<p>S.B. 996 was introduced earlier this year by Pennsylvania Senators Doug Mastriano, Kristin Phillips-Hill, Judy Ward, and Michele Brooks. S.B. 996 will protect parental rights in Pennsylvania law, strengthening the right of parents to direct the education, upbringing, and care of their children. And it will allow Pennsylvania to join the fifteen other states in the nation that already have a similar law on their books.</p>



<p>
<strong>Please contact your senator and urge him or her to support S.B. 996.</strong> You can find their contact information <a href="https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/home/member_information/contact.cfm?body=S" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>



<p>Your message can be as simple as the following:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>
<em>“Please vote in favor of S.B. 996 to enshrine into Pennsylvania law that parental rights are a fundamental right. This common-sense bill will take the U.S. Supreme Court’s precedent from the last 100 years and put it into the text of Pennsylvania law, thereby protecting the constitutional rights of all Pennsylvania families.”</em>
</p>
</blockquote>



<p>If you send an email to your Pennsylvania senator, you can also send them the link to our letter in support of S.B. 996, available <a href="https://parentalrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ParentalRights.org-letter-in-support-of-PA-S.B.-996-parental-rights.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>

<strong>SB 866, Vaccine Consent for Minors, would force children as young as 12 to make major medical decisions without a parent’s input, knowledge, or support.</strong> It will open the door for peer pressure and coercion, rather than wisdom, caution, and knowledge of one’s family medical history, to drive children’s health.</p>



<p>Introduced in the Senate by Sens. Pan and Wiener, the bill has already passed that chamber, and then passed the Assembly Judiciary Committee on a 6-4 vote last week. If it passes the Assembly on this upcoming vote, it will go to the governor’s desk.</p>



<p>Regardless of where one stands on vaccines, removing parents from major decisions in a child’s life is certain to have negative consequences. The Supreme Court of the United States has already upheld the vital role that parents play in making these decisions for which children, by virtue of simply being children, are not yet ready to make.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>But Senators Pan and Wiener are not concerned about that. Their bill is poised to ignore parents’ rights and children’s needs.</p>



<p>
<strong>Take Action</strong>
</p>



<p>Take a moment right now to <a href="https://findyourrep.legislature.ca.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">call or email your Assemblyman</a> and urge him or her to <strong>vote “No” on SB 866</strong>. (Because this bill can come for a vote literally at any moment, there is no time to delay!)</p>



<p>Your message can be as simple as the following (but in your own words):</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>
<em>“Please vote “No” on S.B. 866, Vaccine Consent for Minors. This bill threatens parental rights and endangers children. Parents are a child’s greatest advocate and protection when it comes to making health care decisions, including immunizations. Children should not be forced to make irreversible medical decisions on their own.” </em>
</p>
</blockquote>



<p>
<strong>Explanation and Talking Points</strong>
</p>



<p>S.B. 866 is another attack on parental rights. It treats children as adults, when their parents, not young children, should decide health care decisions, such as vaccine administration.<strong>&amp;nbsp;</strong>
</p>



<p>
<strong>And it endangers children.&amp;nbsp;</strong>A minor child may not know his or her medical history. A minor child may consent to an immunization, and then suffer an adverse reaction, and if the parent does not know that the child was immunized, may miss warning signs and be unable to get the child to the hospital in time. Or, a parent may not know that their child received an immunization at school, and have their family pediatrician administer the same immunization, resulting in potential harm due to multiple and unnecessary doses.</p>



<p>
<strong>The Parental Rights Foundation recently </strong>
<a href="https://parentalrightsfoundation.org/district-court-grants-injunction-against-dc-minor-consent-act/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
<strong>won a preliminary injunction </strong>
</a>
<strong>in federal district court against a similar law in the District of Columbia.</strong> We encourage you to <a href="https://parentalrightsfoundation.org/district-court-grants-injunction-against-dc-minor-consent-act/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">

<strong>federal judge’s memorandum opinion</strong>
</a>. We believe this victory is more evidence that S.B. 866 should be rejected by the California legislature. </p>



<p>Thank you for standing with us to protect children by empowering parents in California! We encourage you to forward this email to several of your friends. We can win this battle for our children and for parental rights if all of us parents stand together.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Last week, <em>your calls made the difference</em>. After the Committee of Conference initially killed H.B. 1431, the Parents’ Bill of Rights, <strong>the same committee reversed itself and approved the bill!</strong> This is <em>unprecedented</em> – and it is because you and so many parents like you stepped up and called your legislators and made your voices heard.</p>



<p>
<strong>Now we need one more push.</strong> The New Hampshire House and Senate will hold a final vote this week on H.B. 1431, the Parents’ Bill of Rights.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>
<strong>Please call your </strong>
<a href="https://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/house/members/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
<strong>New Hampshire Representative</strong>
</a>
<strong> and </strong>
<a href="http://gencourt.state.nh.us/senate/members/wml.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
<strong>New Hampshire State Senator</strong>
</a> and ask them, respectfully but firmly, to stand with moms and dads and children across the state by voting in favor of H.B. 1431, the Parents’ Bill of Rights.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Your message can be as simple as the following:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>
<em>Please vote to support H.B. 1431, the Parents’ Bill of Rights. This bill will enshrine into New Hampshire law that parental rights are a fundamental right, as the U.S. Supreme Court has held for the past 100 years. Additionally, H.B. 1431 will protect children in New Hampshire’s public schools by allowing parents to know what is going on and make critical decisions with their own children in their local public school.&amp;nbsp; Passage of this bill into law will make New Hampshire the 16th state in the nation to protect parental rights as a fundamental right in the state code. Children need their parents, and this bill will ensure that New Hampshire parents are able to support and care for their children, not be cut out of the loop.&amp;nbsp;</em>
</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Then, please do one other thing: <strong>Please forward this email to as many of your friends and family members in New Hampshire as you can.</strong>&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Large, national organizations with millions of dollars in revenue are pressuring your New Hampshire legislators and Governor Sununu to kill this bill, <strong>arguing that government employees in public schools know your child better than you do</strong>, and that they – not parents – should make the final decision of what goes on in the classroom with your own child. This is a fundamental battle over whether parents or government employees are in charge.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>We cannot match these organizations’ money. But what we lack in funds, we can make up in standing together. Parents love their children, raise their children, spend sleepless nights concerned for their children, and must not then be cut out from some of the most important decisions concerning their children’s very identity and future. <strong>Please forward this email to your friends and family members in New Hampshire and ask them to also call their legislators with this message in support of H.B. 1431, the Parents’ Bill of Rights.</strong>
</p>



<p>You can read our letter of support for <a href="https://parentalrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ParentalRights.org-letter-in-support-of-NH-H.B.-1431-The-Parents-Bill-of-Rights.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">H.B. 1431 here</a>. Thank you for standing up to protect children by empowering parents!</p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>

<strong>, the Parents’ Bill of Rights.&amp;nbsp;</strong>
</p>



<p>This excellent bill, which establishes the fundamental right of parents in New Hampshire state law, has already passed the New Hampshire House and Senate. However, <strong>disagreements over which version to send to the Governor are threatening passage</strong>. The conference committee is meeting at 9 am to find a path forward, and news reports stating the bill is dead are not accurate as of this moment.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>ParentalRights.org supports both the House and Senate version. <strong>Either one will provide significant protections for parents and children in New Hampshire law</strong>, and either one will make New Hampshire the 16th state in the nation to protect parental rights as a fundamental right in state law.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>
<strong>Please call you legislators as soon as possible and tell them the following message:</strong>
</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“I urge you to support the Parents’ Bill of Rights. <strong>Either the House or Senate version will significantly increase the protection of children and families in state law.</strong> Please work with your colleagues in the legislature to ensure that a final bill protecting parental rights is sent to the Governor’s desk.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Please, if you are seeing this in time, don’t hesitate to <em>call now</em>. So many of you fellow New Hampshire citizens will not see this email until it is too late—They are counting on you!</p>



<p>Thank you for standing up to protect children by empowering parents!</p>

<![CDATA[<p>I’ve got Georgia on my mind.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>
<strong>On April 28, Georgia Governor Brian Kemp signed into law House Bill 1178, the Parents’ Bill of Rights. </strong>
<em>[ParentalRights.org supported this bill with statewide grassroots efforts and </em>
<a href="https://parentalrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ParentalRights.org-letter-in-support-of-GA-H.B.-1178-The-Parents-Bill-of-Rights.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
<em>this letter of support</em>
</a>
<em> to lawmakers.]</em>
</p>



<p>This is a big deal. In addition to providing Georgia parents with strong legal protections to ensure that they are able to (1) know what their children are learning in public schools and (2) be involved in their children’s education, the Georgia Parents’ Bill of Rights boldly adds the following into Georgia state law:</p>



<p>“No state or local government entity, governing body, or any officer, employee, or agent thereof may infringe on the fundamental right of a parent to direct the upbringing and education of his or her minor child without demonstrating that such action is reasonable and necessary to achieve a compelling state interest and that such action is narrowly tailored and is not otherwise served by less restrictive means.”</p>



<p>
<strong>Georgia is now the 15th state in the nation to protect parental rights as a fundamental right in state code.&amp;nbsp;</strong>
</p>



<p>“Fundamental rights” is the legal term in our nation for those God-given rights that are the most precious and that receive the strongest protections by our nation’s laws. And the language in the Georgia Parents’ Bill of Rights about “a compelling state interest” that is “narrowly tailored” and “not otherwise served by less restrictive means” is known in legal circles as “strict scrutiny.” This language ensures that <strong>
<em>any</em>
</strong>
<strong> governmental action that could infringe on the fundamental right of a parent to direct the upbringing and education of his or her child will face “strict scrutiny.</strong>
<strong>
<em>” </em>
</strong>This is a <em>very </em>high bar for the government. An example of government action that would meet this high legal bar is law enforcements’ removal of a child from a home for physical abuse by a caregiver.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>The passage into law of the Georgia Parents’ Bill of Rights is significant for another reason: <strong>it is a major legislative win for parents who have been ignored by the education establishment.</strong> Ever since the COVID-19 pandemic shut down public schools in the spring of 2020 and pulled back the curtain on what children were learning (or not learning), we have seen deepening frustration from parents across the nation. And as parents were ignored by the education establishment, this frustration built. It helped <a href="https://www.dailysignal.com/2021/11/03/lesson-from-virginia-election-education-can-be-winning-issue-for-republicans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">propel Governor Glenn Youngkin to victory</a> in Virginia in November 2021. It led to the ouster of <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/voices/2022/03/08/san-francisco-school-board-recall/6974316001/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">three school board members</a> in deep-blue San Francisco earlier this year. But legislative wins have been elusive.</p>



<p>That started to change when Florida, where ParentalRights.org already helped pass a law in 2021 enshrining “the fundamental rights of a parent to direct the upbringing, education, health care, and mental health of his or her minor child,” built on that success this year by passing H.B. 1557, “Parental Rights in Education.” But even though this was a major win for Florida parents, <strong>Florida seemed to be an outlier in heeding the cries by parents who had been ignored by the education establishment.</strong> Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers had <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/wisconsin-democrat-governor-evers-vetoes-parental-bill-rights-gop-bills" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently vetoed a bill</a> in Wisconsin that would have also enshrined parental rights as a fundamental right. The South Dakota Senate Judiciary Committee <a href="https://www.argusleader.com/story/news/education/2022/02/24/south-dakota-senate-committee-kills-parents-fundamental-rights-bill/6930933001/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">killed a fundamental parental rights bill</a>, even though the bill had earlier passed the South Dakota House of Representatives by a bipartisan vote of 63–5. A fundamental parental rights bill was <a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb22-1236" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">killed by a Colorado House Committee</a>. Other bills championed by parents were stalled or weakened across the nation.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>All of this has come despite the growing evidence that <strong>parental rights have wide bipartisan support.</strong> For example, a <a href="https://maristpoll.marist.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/NPR_PBS-NewsHour_Marist-Poll_USA-NOS-and-Tables_202204271123.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent NPR/Marist poll</a> showed that <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidIRamadan/status/1520394391655010306" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Independents, Latinos, and, significantly, households with children under the age of 18</a> are inclined to vote Republican in wide margins. I don’t think this is necessarily because these individuals now identify as Republicans. But I think <strong>it <em>is</em> the Glenn Youngkin effect again:</strong> parents are frustrated that their concerns relating to their own children’s education is being ignored. And at this juncture, it appears that only Republican candidates and elected officials are listening to them.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>
<strong>That is why Georgia’s successful passage into law of the Parents’ Bill of Rights was so significant. It shows that Florida is not an outlier. It shows that parents are winning, and that the tide may be turning</strong>.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>After Georgia, we are watching New Hampshire. House Bill 1431, which creates a parental bill of rights, has already passed the New Hampshire House and <a href="https://indepthnh.org/2022/04/28/senate-backs-parents-bill-of-rights/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently passed the New Hampshire Senate</a>. In Missouri, House Bill 1858, which provides curriculum transparency to parents of children in Missouri public schools, has also passed the Missouri House, and is poised to pass the Missouri Senate. Other curriculum transparency bills are moving across the nation.</p>



<p>
<strong>Georgia shows us that elected officials are starting to listen to parents. It shows that parents are winning. </strong>And it should remind us, yet again, that <a href="https://www.dailysignal.com/2022/01/19/parents-are-winning-thats-why-the-far-left-is-turning-us-into-bogeymen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">parental rights are bipartisan</a>. Elected officials across the political spectrum should sit up, take notice, and support the right of parents in the education of their precious children.</p>



<p>Thank you for standing with us and making victories like this one in Georgia possible!</p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>



<p>Will Estrada<br>President</p>

<![CDATA[<p>We need your help to stop <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220SB866" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">S.B. 866</a>, a bill that <strong>authorizes 12 year old children to consent to immunizations without their parents knowing about it or giving their consent</strong>. This bill has been introduced by California State Senators Scott Wiener and Richard Pan, coauthored by Senator Josh Newman, and coauthored in the California State Assembly by Buffy Wicks, Cecilia Aguiar-Curry, Laura Friedman, Evan Low, Phil Ting, and Akilah Weber.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>
<strong>S.B. 866 is scheduled to be heard by the Senate Judiciary Committee tomorrow, Thursday, May 5.</strong> You can see more about this scheduled hearing <a href="https://sjud.senate.ca.gov/content/may-5-2022-hearing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>



<p>
<strong>Please call or email (or both!) your </strong>
<a href="https://findyourrep.legislature.ca.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
<strong>California State Senator</strong>
</a> and ask him or her to oppose S.B. 866. Your message can be as simple as the following:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Please oppose S.B. 866, a bill which allows minors to consent to vaccinations. This bill threatens parental rights and endangers children. Parents are a child’s greatest advocate and protection when it comes to making health care decisions, including immunizations. Children should not be forced to make irreversible medical decisions on their own.” </p>
</blockquote>



<p>S.B. 866 is another attack on parental rights. It treats children as adults, when their parents, not young children, should decide health care decisions, such as vaccine administration. <strong>And it endangers children.</strong> A minor child may not know his or her medical history. A minor child may consent to an immunization, and then suffer an adverse reaction, and if the parent does not know that the child was immunized, may miss warning signs and be unable to get the child to the hospital in time. Or, a parent may not know that their child received an immunization at school, and have their family pediatrician administer the same immunization, resulting in potential harm due to multiple and unnecessary doses.</p>



<p>
<strong>The Parental Rights Foundation recently won <a href="https://parentalrightsfoundation.org/district-court-grants-injunction-against-dc-minor-consent-act/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a preliminary injunction</a> in federal district court against a similar law in the District of Columbia. </strong>We encourage you to <a href="https://parentalrightsfoundation.org/district-court-grants-injunction-against-dc-minor-consent-act/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">read our story about our lawsuit</a>, and to read the <a href="https://parentalrightsfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Booth-DC-Memorandum-Opinion-18-Mar-22.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">federal judge’s memorandum opinion</a>. We believe this victory is more evidence that S.B. 866 should be rejected by the California legislature. </p>



<p>We encourage you to forward this email to several of your friends. We can win this battle for our children and for parental rights if all of us parents stand together.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>

<![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.nj.gov/education/cccs/2020/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2020 New Jersey Learning Standards</a> are currently scheduled to be implemented in September, 2022. However, <strong>the standards, especially in the area of Comprehensive Health and Physical Education, are very concerning to many parents.</strong> Even Governor Murphy <a href="https://nj.gov/governor/news/news/562022/approved/20220413a.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has acknowledged</a> the concerns being expressed by New Jersey parents.</p>



<p>Right now, parents are reaching out to the State Board of Education with their thoughts on what their children should learn in this critical subject in New Jersey public schools.</p>



<p>In light of this, we want to make you aware that this is happening and encourage you, if you wish, to <strong>weigh in with an email to the state school board by Wednesday, May 4. </strong>
</p>



<p>With so much discussion over what children should be learning in public schools, it is vital that parents’ voices be heard. To ensure that every parent has a chance to be heard, we suggest urging the state school board to <strong>delay the implementation of the standards for another six months for public and parent review and input.</strong>
</p>



<p>
<strong>Please consider emailing the state school board at <a href="mailto:stateboardoffice@doe.nj.gov" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stateboardoffice@doe.nj.gov</a> </strong>with a message such as the following. We encourage you to put it into your own words, so it comes from your heart:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>
<em>Dear State School Board Member,</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>I am writing to urge you to delay implementation of the 2020 New Jersey Learning Standards, especially the Comprehensive Health and Physical Education standards, to review and amend the standards based on further public and parent review and input.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>Even Governor Murphy has acknowledged the high level of concern. This must be addressed, and the material and mandates removed or mitigated to protect children, and to ensure that the views of families from across the political, religious, and cultural spectrums are respected.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>Acting Commissioner of Education Angelica Allen-McMillan tried to explain that “the NJ [Department of Education] does not review, approve, or actively endorse instructional materials,” but this does not match the reality that the DOE website includes links to divisive curriculum materials, and that local schools are telling parents the curriculum choice is out of their control—that they have to teach the materials provided by the NJDOE.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>During the June 2020 State School Board vote, four State School Board Members voted against the material in Comprehensive Health and Physical Education, stating that it was not appropriate. It only passed based on assurances that parents could opt their children out of objectionable content, or content that is not age appropriate. But such parental opt-out is not currently guaranteed.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>Transparency AND parental notification and consent&amp;nbsp;</em>
<strong>
<em>must be required</em>
</strong>
<em>. Respecting family values and parental rights is paramount.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>Please respect the vital role of New Jersey parents in their children’s education by postponing the implementation date, gathering parental input, and amending the standards to honor the voices of all New Jersey parents.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>Respectfully,</em>
</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Thank you for taking the time to make your voice heard. Together as concerned parents, we can make the schools better for our children.</p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>

<![CDATA[<p>We talk a lot about <a href="https://parentalrights.org/parents-efforts-around-the-country-starting-to-pay-off/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">good bills that we’re working on</a> across the nation: legislation like our Parents’ Bill of Rights and fundamental parental rights bills that will strengthen the right of parents to raise, educate, and care for their children.</p>



<p>
<strong>But thanks to your support of ParentalRights.org, we also work aggressively to stop bad bills that would erode the rights that we hold dear.&amp;nbsp;</strong>
</p>



<p>Sometimes our work is overtly public, like the <a href="https://parentalrights.org/call-congress-now-to-stop-creation-of-massive-government-database/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent action alert</a> we sent out nationwide, urging you to call your US Representative and two US Senators to <strong>oppose language that would create a federal database</strong> of college students and college graduates. (And now that Congress has returned from their Easter and Passover recess, we <a href="https://parentalrights.org/call-congress-now-to-stop-creation-of-massive-government-database/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">urge you to call</a> your federal representatives again!)&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>
<strong>But sometimes our work is behind the scenes.</strong> Just a few hours before I stopped to write you this update, I was on a lengthy Zoom meeting with my colleagues from <a href="https://hslda.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HSLDA</a> and <a href="https://mache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MACHE</a>, as well as others in the state of Minnesota, to try to stop <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bills/bill.php?f=SF4435&amp;b=senate&amp;y=2022&amp;ssn=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a MN bill</a> that <strong>would have allowed social workers to interview children at school, without telling their parents, if the social worker thought it necessary.</strong> This violates the US Constitution’s Fourth Amendment. But without our work behind the scenes, this could have easily passed. I’m pleased to tell you that the dangerous language was stripped out of the bill, and we’re monitoring it so that it is not put back in during the legislative process.</p>



<p>Another bill we defeated through behind-the-scenes work was a dangerous <a href="https://www.legislature.ohio.gov/legislation/legislation-summary?id=GA134-HB-529" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">curriculum transparency bill in Ohio</a> that inexplicably <strong>would have required private schools and homeschools to publish their curriculum.</strong> We’re all for curriculum transparency for public schools, which are funded through our taxpayer dollars. Parents should know what their children are being taught in public schools. But private schools and homeschools should be free from governmental mandates requiring them to disclose their curriculum. That’s a fight worth having.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>And, we were able to defeat a <a href="https://www.wvlegislature.gov/bill_status/bills_history.cfm?INPUT=3099&amp;year=2022&amp;sessiontype=RS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dangerous grandparent visitation bill in West Virginia</a> that would have stripped rights away from parents. I know firsthand the incredible blessing that grandparents can be in their children’s life. My wife recently lost her dad to a heart attack, and her mom to COVID-19. Their passing has left a hole in our family and in our kids’ lives that will not be filled on this side of eternity. I’m grateful to still have my mom and dad with us, and to see the love that they have for their grandkids, my two boys. <strong>But not all grandparents are like these, and we must never forget that state law must protect parental rights.</strong> I’m glad that the West Virginia legislature recognized its duty under the Constitutions of the state of West Virginia and of the United States, and that this bill has been stopped for this year.</p>



<p>These highlights are just a sampling of how ParentalRights.org protects your God-given right to raise your children by standing against dangerous legislation. <strong>Much of the credit must go to our dedicated volunteers and supporters in all 50 states who are the boots on the ground in our efforts. </strong>Without them—and you—I can say with confidence that we would not be celebrating these victories right now.</p>



<p>Gratefully yours,</p>

<![CDATA[<p>We’re excited to let you know that <a href="https://www.scstatehouse.gov/billsearch.php?billnumbers=288&amp;session=124&amp;summary=B" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">S. 288</a>, a good bill introduced by Senators Wes Climer, Greg Hembree, and Josh Kimbrell, is moving in the South Carolina Senate Judiciary Committee! S. 288 will protect innocent families from being caught up in child neglect investigations.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>S. 288 amends South Carolina law to clarify that <strong>a loving and caring parent who allows his or her child to engage in “independent activities” will not be considered to have neglected the child.</strong>
</p>



<p>S. 288 enjoys broad bipartisan support from advocacy groups across the political spectrum, including ParentalRights.org, the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) (whose model bill South Carolina’s legislation mirrors), Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA), and Let Grow.</p>



<p>
<strong>Please contact </strong>
<a href="https://www.scstatehouse.gov/member.php?chamber=S" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
<strong>your state senator</strong>
</a>
<strong> and ask him or her to support S. 288.</strong> You can call or email (or both!) your senator with a message as simple as the following:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Please support S. 288 to provide children with reasonable independence. At a time when it seems that government is encroaching more and more on loving parents and their ability to care for and raise their children, S. 288 provides freedom to parents to let their children grow and thrive, freeing South Carolina’s Department of Social Services to focus attention on children who are truly in danger of abuse or neglect.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>If you decide to email your state senator, feel free to link to the <a href="https://parentalrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ParentalRights.org-letter-in-support-of-SC-S-288.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">letter that we sent</a> to the sponsors of S. 288.</p>

<strong>Calls are needed today to support </strong>

<strong>H.B. 1858</strong>
</a>
<strong>, the Parents’ Bill of Rights</strong>, that has been working its way through the Missouri House of Representatives since it was prefiled on December 7, 2021. ParentalRights.org, and our allies at <a href="http://www.hslda.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA)</a> and <a href="https://fhe-mo.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Families for Home Education (FHE)</a> have been working behind the scenes to strengthen the language. Thanks to the hard work of our friends at Families for Home Education, ParentalRights.org strongly supports the <a href="https://house.mo.gov/billtracking/bills221/hlrbillspdf/4070H.03P.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">perfected version of the bill</a>. </p>



<p>If passed into law, H.B. 1858, the Parents’ Bill of Rights, will do the following:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Reiterate in Missouri State Code that parents have the “right to enroll the parent’s minor child in a public school or, as an alternative to public education, a private school, including a religious school, a home education program, or other available options, as authorized by law.”</li>
<li>Give parents the right to know what their children are being taught in public schools;</li>
<li>Give parents the right to visit their children during the school day;</li>
<li>Protect the privacy and biometric data of children;</li>
<li>Require school board meetings regarding curriculum, school safety, and student issues to be held in public and allow for public comments;</li>
<li>Prohibit school districts from requiring parents to sign nondisclosure agreements before viewing public school curricula;</li>
<li>And provide numerous additional protections to parents and their children in public schools.</li>
</ul>



<p>
<strong>ParentalRights.org strongly supports this bill.</strong> It was placed on the Missouri House of Representatives’ Informal Third Reading Calendar on April 14 and <strong>could be voted on by the full House in the coming days.</strong>&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>
<strong>Please call your </strong>
<a href="https://www.senate.mo.gov/LegisLookup/Default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
<strong>Missouri State Representative</strong>
</a>
<strong> today and urge him or her to support H.B. 1858.</strong> Your message can be as simple as the following:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Please support H.B. 1858, the Parents’ Bill of Rights. This critical bill will protect children and families by strengthening parental rights. Additionally, it will allow parents of public school students to be involved in their children’s education, and will protect children’s personal information and data.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>If passed into law, H.B. 1858 will allow Missouri to join the growing number of states across the nation that ensure that parents are able to be involved in their children’s public schools and know what is being taught in the classroom.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Congress is poised to eliminate a long-standing federal law that prohibits the creation of a national database of students, and then <strong>create a massive federal database of college students, college graduates, and every single new college graduate employed in the private and public sector.</strong>
</p>



<p>Simply called “College Transparency,” this massive expansion of big government, supported by big-tech and big-data companies, was quietly inserted into the House-passed version of the America COMPETES Act, a bill that was originally introduced to help the United States compete with Communist China. The Senate wisely did not include this language when it passed its own version of the America COMPETES Act. The dueling versions of this bill will now be resolved by a conference committee.</p>



<p>The bill is ostensibly intended to help college-bound students determine if their favored college major is likely to provide them with a good return on investment. Supporters say the bill will accomplish this by tracking every college student, their field of study, their demographics, and then how much they make when they find a job after college graduation.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>However, ParentalRights.org has long stood against mandatory data collection, tracking, and repositories of student data. <strong>Parents—not schools, bureaucrats, massive multi-national companies, or the federal government—should decide what information is collected about their children.</strong> This is why we worked with our allies in the education field over a decade ago to oppose state and federal K-12 student databases (and private databases like inBloom) when the Common Core State Standards Initiative was being fought across the nation.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>And this is why <strong>we were </strong>
<a href="https://parentalrights.org/florida-adopts-parents-bill-of-rights/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
<strong>proud to back</strong>
</a>
<strong> Florida’s </strong>
<a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2021/241" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
<strong>Parental Bill of Rights</strong>
</a>
<strong> last year, which included strong parental protections on biometric data collection of K-12 students</strong>. After Florida’s bill passed, it became a model for Parental Bills of Rights all across the nation, and we have testified in favor of <a href="https://parentalrights.org/parents-efforts-around-the-country-starting-to-pay-off/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">many of these bills</a> across the states.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>We must not see all of those victories lost by the creation of <strong>a new federal database that simply defeats all of our attempts to protect student privacy</strong> by collecting the data once students go to college and into careers after that.</p>



<p>ParentalRights.org sent a letter to members of the House and Senate Conference Committee on Tuesday, April 12, urging them to oppose “College Transparency.” We encourage you to <a href="https://parentalrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/ParentalRights.org-letter-in-opposition-to-House-passed-College-Transparency-in-America-COMPETES-Act.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">read the letter</a> to see just how dangerous this proposal is.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Then, <strong>please call your US representative and both of your US senators.</strong> You can find who represents you and their phone number by clicking <a href="https://www.congress.gov/members?q=%7B%22congress%22%3A117%7D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Here is a suggested message:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“As one of your constituents, I urge you to oppose the College Transparency program in the House-passed version of the America COMPETES Act. Please adopt the Senate-passed version instead. I oppose any attempt to create a federal database on college students and college graduates, or to repeal long-standing federal laws that prohibit the creation of national databases on students. Our nation should protect individual privacy.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Thank you for standing with us to protect student privacy and to oppose national databases on student information. Parents and students, not the federal government, should decide what information they share.</p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>



<p>Will Estrada<br>President, ParentalRights.org</p>

<![CDATA[<p>On Tuesday, the New Hampshire Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing on two good bills, <a href="https://gencourt.state.nh.us/bill_status/legacy/bs2016/bill_status.aspx?lsr=2050&amp;sy=2022&amp;sortoption=&amp;txtsessionyear=2022&amp;txtbillnumber=HB1612" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">H.B. 1612</a> to protect families from false reports of child abuse and neglect, and <a href="https://gencourt.state.nh.us/bill_status/legacy/bs2016/bill_status.aspx?lsr=2285&amp;sy=2022&amp;sortoption=&amp;txtsessionyear=2022&amp;txtbillnumber=HB1431" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">H.B. 1431, the Parents’ Bill of Rights</a>. </p>



<p>Attorney Mike Donnelly, senior counsel with Home School Legal Defense Association, attended the hearing on behalf of ParentalRights.org and presented <strong>powerful and compelling testimony</strong> to the committee in favor of both bills. You can watch the entire hearing <a href="https://youtu.be/APQvA6-DYmA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. Mike Donnelly testifies in favor of the Parents’ Bill of Rights (H.B. 1431) at 1:54:00, and in favor of H.B. 1612 starting at 2:49:44.</p>



<p>As the Senate Judiciary Committee considers whether to support these two bills, we ask that you <strong>email all the members of the committee and respectfully ask them to support these two bills.</strong> <strong>Importantly, we support Senator Bob Guida’s amendment to the Parents’ Bill of Rights (H.B. 1431) to restore protections for parental rights regarding medical decisions of their minor children.</strong> This good language was in the original bill introduced in the New Hampshire House but was taken out during final passage. Putting this language back into the Parents’ Bill of Rights will further strengthen family freedom when it comes to medical decisions.</p>



<p>You can email all the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee by visiting the <a href="https://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/Senate/committees/committee_details.aspx?cc=33" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Committee page here</a> and clicking “Email Entire Committee.” </p>



<p>Here is a suggested email, but we encourage you to add in your own words, share personal anecdotes, and make changes so it comes from your heart:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Dear Members of the New Hampshire Senate Judiciary Committee:</p>
<p>I ask that you support H.B. 1612 and H.B. 1431. Both of these bills have already passed the New Hampshire House of Representatives, and both of these bills will protect children and families in New Hampshire.  </p>
<p>H.B. 1612 will add in more accountability to the reporting of child abuse and neglect in New Hampshire. It will set in place safeguards to help protect innocent children and families from going through the trauma of an unnecessary governmental child abuse or neglect investigation by making it harder for bad actors to file false reports of abuse and neglect. Additionally, H.B. 1612 will create penalties for false reports of child abuse, further protecting innocent children and families. This bill will help to keep bad actors from weaponizing the system against innocent families.</p>
<p>H.B. 1431, the Parents’ Bill of Rights, will enshrine into New Hampshire law that parental rights are a fundamental right, as the U.S. Supreme Court has held for the past 100 years. Additionally, H.B. 1431 will protect parents and children in New Hampshire’s public schools by allowing parents to make critical decisions regarding their own children.  Passage of this bill into law will make New Hampshire the 15th state in the nation to protect parental rights as a fundamental right in the state code. In addition to asking that you support H.B. 1431, I respectfully request that you accept Senator Bob Guida’s amendment to restore protections for parental rights when it comes to medical decisions for their minor children. </p>

<![CDATA[<p>We are excited to let you know that <a href="https://legis.delaware.gov/BillDetail?LegislationId=79184" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">H.B. 326</a>, a bill to provide curriculum transparency to Delaware families who have children in public schools, will be heard in committee on Wednesday, April 6.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>H.B. 326 has been introduced by primary sponsor Representative Charles Postles and by additional sponsors Senators Bryant Richardson and David Wilson. H.B. 326 is cosponsored by Representatives Ruth Briggs King, Richard Collins, Ronald Gray, Michael Ramone, Daniel Short, Jesse Vanderwende, and Lyndon Yearick, and by Senators Colin Bonini, Gerald Hocker, and Brian Pettyjohn.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>
<strong>H.B. 326 provides numerous curriculum transparency provisions to parents of students in Delaware public and charter schools</strong>, establishes strong provisions ensuring that parents can be involved in their children’s education in the public schools, and includes a provision stating <strong>“any citizen denied access to information as provided in this act may bring suit within 45 days of such denial.”</strong>
</p>



<p>Passage of H.B. 326 into law will provide Delaware parents with strong protections of their right to direct the education of their children in Delaware public schools. Our friends at the <a href="https://delawarefamilies.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Delaware Family Policy Council</a> also support H.B. 326 and had this to say about the bill: <strong>“Parental involvement in their child’s education is non-negotiable.</strong> HB 326 would ensure that parents have full access to the policies, teachers, and curricula of their child’s public or charter school.”</p>



<p>
<strong>The House Education Committee will hold a hearing on H.B. 326 on Wednesday, April 6, at 3:00 PM. </strong>You can find out more information, including how to testify in person, via phone, or provide written testimony via email, <a href="https://legis.delaware.gov/MeetingNotice/22745" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by visiting the Committee website here.</a>&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>We encourage you to <strong>contact your Delaware Representative and Senator</strong>, as well as the members of the House Education Committee, in support of H.B. 326. You can find your legislator’s contact information <a href="https://legis.delaware.gov/FindMyLegislator?search=" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Your message in support of H.B. 326 can be as simple as the following:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>I urge you to support H.B. 326 to provide Delaware parents with opportunities to be involved in their children’s education in public schools, and to provide them with information about what their children are being taught. This commonsense bill will help improve public education by engaging parents in their children’s public schools and will protect the fundamental right of parents to direct the education of their children.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Thank you for standing with us for parental rights in Delaware! Please consider forwarding this email to a couple of friends. Let’s stand together to protect children by empowering parents!</p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>

We encourage you to <strong>contact the Senate Judiciary Committee</strong> in support of these bills, and to come testify in person if you are able.</p>



<p>The Senate Judiciary Committee will hear <a href="https://gencourt.state.nh.us/bill_status/legacy/bs2016/bill_status.aspx?lsr=2050&amp;sy=2022&amp;sortoption=&amp;txtsessionyear=2022&amp;txtbillnumber=HB1612" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">H.B. 1612</a>, a bill that will begin to change <strong>New Hampshire’s child abuse and neglect reporting laws from anonymous to confidential.</strong> H.B. 1612 will also create penalties for someone who knowingly makes a false report of child abuse. H.B. 1612 previously passed the New Hampshire House of Representatives by a vote of 175-161.</p>



<p>The Senate Judiciary Committee will also hear <a href="https://gencourt.state.nh.us/bill_status/legacy/bs2016/bill_status.aspx?lsr=2285&amp;sy=2022&amp;sortoption=&amp;txtsessionyear=2022&amp;txtbillnumber=HB1431" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">H.B. 1431, the Parents’ Bill of Rights</a>.

</p>
<p>Work is underway to gain an updated understanding of the current American mindset. But these numbers, even if a little dated, paint a clear picture of a country that is <strong>not the least divided on what the proper role of parents should be</strong> in the lives of their children—and that government interference is generally not wanted or needed.</p>
<p>Regardless of religion, political party, ethnicity, or any other factor that this poll could identify, <strong>Americans are united on this</strong>: unless there is proof of abuse or neglect, parents, not government, have the right to make decisions for their children.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>More than 40 of the 50 states allow anonymous calls to their child abuse hotlines. This opens the door for less-than-honest people to <strong>weaponize the child protection system against innocent families</strong> with whom they may have a beef—be it a contentious ex, a nosey neighbor, or a relative who simply thinks they know better than mom or dad.</p>
<p>Every year, roughly <strong>83%</strong> of all child welfare investigations are closed as unfounded or unsubstantiated, and that number is <strong>even higher among cases that begin with an anonymous call.</strong> That’s a lot of resources being wasted chasing ghosts while children who are actually abused are being overlooked.</p>
<p>By replacing anonymous reporting with confidential reporting, <strong>we can save the lives of those children and save thousands of children in innocent families</strong> from the trauma of an unwarranted investigation.</p>
<p>Toward that end, we engage in grassroots efforts to promote bills similar to <a href="https://alec.org/model-policy/confidential-reporting-act/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this model</a>, presented by the <a href="https://parentalrightsfoundation.org/confidential-reporting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Parental Rights Foundation</a> and approved by the American Legislative Exchange Council.</p>
<p>Together we can protect children from unnecessary investigations and streamline the system to find and protect more children in need of services, as well.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Federal law requires each state to maintain a “central registry of child abusers,” but the law does not provide any guidelines for how names are to be added to or kept off the list. As a result, <strong>most states fail to provide any sort of “due process” to keep the names of innocent parents off that list.</strong>
</p>
<p>Every year, thousands of innocent parents across the country find themselves listed as “child abusers,” though they have never abused or neglected a child. This is because, in most states, a child services supervisor or even an investigator can put a name on the list with no trial, no hearing, no judgment against the parent, and no system of review.</p>
<p>As one might expect, roughly 75% of those who appeal this listing come out of the appellate hearing—their first hearing on the matter—with a ruling in their favor and their names are removed from the registry.</p>
<p>
<strong>But what does it say about the accuracy of the registry if 75% of those who appeal never belonged on it in the first place?</strong>
</p>
<p>These lists are used in background checks; having one’s name listed can be a death sentence to one’s career and livelihood. And that’s to say nothing of one’s dreams of fostering or adopting children or, in some cases, of being reunited with their own children.</p>
<p>In a nation founded on the principle of <strong>“innocent until proven guilty,”</strong> this lack of due process is an affront to our sense of justice—and it should be!</p>
<p>Thus, we work to pass legislation in the states, like <a href="https://parentalrightsfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Central-Registry-Reform-Model-for-web-2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this model</a> presented by the <a href="https://parentalrightsfoundation.org/central-registry-due-process/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Parental Rights Foundation</a> and adopted by the American Legislative Exchange Council, to require due process before a name can be added to a child abuse register.</p>
<p>
<strong>Registers can serve a purpose, but only if they are accurate and reliable.</strong> There is no benefit from hurting innocent families. Registries that indiscriminately undermine a parent’s career threaten innocent children (and their families) with poverty and additional hardships.</p>
<p>Together we can protect children by preserving innocent parents’ right to find and retain jobs in their chosen career fields.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Child abuse is a problem that can occur in any ethnic or economic demographic.</p>
<p>So why, nationally, do we see <strong>African-American children subjected to child welfare investigations at a rate 1.5 times</strong> their proportion in the general population? (African-American children make up about 14% of the total U.S. child population, but 21% of the maltreatment population.)</p>
<p>And why is this disproportionality <strong>even higher for Native American children?</strong>
</p>
<p>Many, including a report of the Government Accountability Office, attribute this phenomenon to <strong>racial bias</strong>: the system is set up to expect and find abuse among minority families where other families might receive more latitude.</p>
<p>From a legal standpoint, the problem might be framed thus: if the System has enough free rein to apply racial bias in making decision that can adversely affect children, then <strong>the System has too much free rein</strong>. On the other hand, if the System must respect the proper role of innocent parents in the lives of their own children, even when investigators might disagree with a fit parent’s reasonable decisions, then there will be no room for racial bias to be a factor.</p>
<p>The solution: <strong>respect the rights of <em>all fit parents</em>
</strong>, regardless of ethnicity or skin color (or any other factor).</p>
<p>To this end, we work at the grassroots level to pass laws that preserve and respect the right of fit parents to <a href="https://parentalrightsfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Fundamental-Parental-Rights-Model-for-web-2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">make the best decisions for their own children</a>, including decisions that might grant their child a <a href="https://alec.org/model-policy/free-range-parenting-act/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reasonable level of independence</a> for their age.</p>
<p>Together we are protecting minority children by empowering <em>all</em> parents, <em>including theirs</em>. <strong>Because family unity is not a privilege for some; it’s a fundamental right for all.</strong>

<![CDATA[<p>Across the nation, some state legislatures are starting to adjourn for the year. Others have reached cross-over day, where bills have to pass from one chamber to another or they’re dead for the year. Still other legislatures remain in full swing.</p>



<p>All this year, ordinary moms and dads like you, with your energy and passion, have been making your voices heard to our elected officials—and <strong>it’s exciting to see how it has paid off! </strong>While enacting laws (especially good laws!) can generally take years and multiple legislative sessions, we have seen some victories already this year.</p>



<p>
<strong>Parental Rights Bills</strong>
</p>



<p>
<strong>First, numerous states have introduced bills to enshrine fundamental parental rights</strong>. While 14 states already have these laws on the books (WV, KS, MI, TX, UT, CO, AZ, NV, VA, OK, ID, WY, FL, and MT), numerous states are working toward joining them, or are taking steps to bolster existing laws protecting these rights. Many of these bills also include curriculum transparency provisions so that parents of children in public schools can know what their children are learning:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>
<strong>Colorado</strong>: While Colorado already has codified as public policy that parental rights are fundamental (Colo. Rev. Stat. § 13-22-107[1](a)[III]), a new bill has been introduced to make it even more clear and strengthen this existing law. <a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2022A/bills/2022a_1236_01.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">House Bill 22-1236, The Parent’s Bill Of Rights,</a> will give teeth to current law by stating: “The state, any political subdivision of the state, or any other governmental entity or institution shall not infringe upon the fundamental right of a parent to direct the upbringing, education, and health care of the parent’s minor child without demonstrating that the compelling governmental interest, as applied to the minor child involved, is of the highest order, is narrowly tailored, and cannot be accomplished in a less restrictive manner.” H.B. 22-1236 will be heard in committee on Wednesday, March 23, and Will Estrada is currently scheduled to testify in favor of the bill.&amp;nbsp;</li>
<li>
<strong>Florida</strong>: Last year, ParentalRights.org spearheaded the introduction and passage of one of the strongest parental rights bills in the nation. It was codified at Fla. Stat. § 1014.03 and has served as a model across the nation. This year, legislators introduced <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2022/1557" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">House Bill 1557, Parental Rights in Education</a>, to provide additional protections to children in public schools. H.B. 1557 has passed the Florida legislature and is currently pending before Governor Ron DeSantis.&amp;nbsp;</li>
<li>
<strong>Georgia</strong>: <a href="https://www.legis.ga.gov/legislation/61677" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">House Bill 1178, the Parents’ Bill of Rights</a>, recently passed the House on a 98–68 vote and is now pending in the Senate.</li>
<li>
<strong>Hawaii</strong>: <a href="https://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/measure_indiv.aspx?billtype=HB&amp;billnumber=2295&amp;year=2022" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">House Bill 2295, The Parental Bill of Rights</a>, has been introduced and is pending in committee.&amp;nbsp;</li>
<li>
<strong>Kansas</strong>: While Kansas protected parental rights as a fundamental right in 1996 (<em>see </em>Kan. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 38-141(2)(b) and Kan. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 60-5305(a)(1)), <a href="http://www.kslegislature.org/li/b2021_22/measures/sb496/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Senate Bill 496, The Parents’ Bill of Rights</a>, would strengthen existing state law. The Senate Committee on Education has recommended that the bill be passed.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</li>
<li>
<strong>Michigan</strong>: While Michigan has protected parental rights as a fundamental right since 1996 (Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. § 380.10), a new bill, <a href="https://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(rnihvucpk0fir4z0cfmo4ggu))/mileg.aspx?page=getObject&amp;objectName=2022-HB-5703" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">House Bill 5703</a>, would require text to be posted at school board meetings and in school district offices to remind elected officials of their duty to respect the rights of parents. H.B. 5703 has passed the Michigan House by a vote of 106–85 and is pending in the Senate Education Committee.&amp;nbsp;</li>
<li>
<strong>Minnesota</strong>: <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bills/bill.php?f=HF3444&amp;y=2022&amp;ssn=0&amp;b=house" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">House File 3444, The Parent’s Bill of Rights,</a> and a companion bill in the Senate, <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bills/bill.php?f=SF3064&amp;y=2022&amp;ssn=0&amp;b=senate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Senate File 3064</a>, have been introduced to protect parental rights as a fundamental right. Both bills are currently pending in committee.&amp;nbsp;</li>
<li>
<strong>Missouri</strong>: <a href="https://house.mo.gov/bill.aspx?bill=HB1858&amp;year=2022&amp;code=R" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">House Bill 1858</a>, the Parents’ Bill of Rights Act, has passed out of its first committee on a 15–6 vote, and is currently pending before a second committee.&amp;nbsp;</li>
<li>
<strong>New Hampshire</strong>: <a href="http://gencourt.state.nh.us/bill_status/billinfo.aspx?id=1378" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">House Bill 1431, The Parents’ Bill of Rights</a>, passed the New Hampshire House on March 15, 2022, on a 181–157 vote and is now pending in the Senate.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</li>
<li>
<strong>Pennsylvania</strong>: <a href="https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billinfo/billinfo.cfm?syear=2021&amp;sind=0&amp;body=S&amp;type=B&amp;bn=0996" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Senate Bill 996, The Parental Rights Protection Act,</a> has been introduced and is pending in committee.</li>
<li>
<strong>Rhode Island</strong>: <a href="http://webserver.rilin.state.ri.us/BillText/BillText22/HouseText22/H7138.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">House Bill 7138, The Parents Bill of Rights Act,</a> was introduced, but was held in committee for further study.&amp;nbsp;</li>
<li>
<strong>South Dakota</strong>: <a href="https://sdlegislature.gov/Session/Bill/23092" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">House Bill 1246,</a> to establish the fundamental right of a parent, was introduced in the House. Our president, Will Estrada, testified before the House Judiciary Committee, and the bill unanimously passed out of committee. It then passed the House on a 63–5 vote. However, despite such a strong showing in the House, the Senate Judiciary Committee unfortunately killed the bill for this session.</li>
<li>
<strong>Wisconsin</strong>: <a href="https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2021/proposals/ab963" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assembly Bill 963</a>, a parental rights bill, has passed both the Assembly (by a vote of 60–34) and Senate (by a vote of 19–12) and has been transmitted to Governor Tony Evers.&amp;nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>
<strong>Other Positive Legislation</strong>
</p>



<p>Second, ParentalRights.org works on legislation to <strong>protect innocent families from the trauma of unnecessary CPS investigations.</strong> In New Hampshire, <a href="https://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/bill_status/billinfo.aspx?id=1143&amp;inflect=2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">House Bill 1612,</a> which would replace anonymous reporting of child abuse and neglect with <a href="https://parentalrightsfoundation.org/confidential-reporting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confidential reporting</a>, passed the House on March 15 on a 175–161 vote and is pending in the Senate.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Third, ParentalRights.org works on legislation to clarify that <a href="https://parentalrightsfoundation.org/reasonable-independence-model/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reasonable parental decisions</a> that help children gain <strong>reasonable independence should not be considered child neglect</strong>. We are working with numerous allied organizations in three states to advance these bills. In Colorado, <a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb22-1090" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">House Bill 22-1090</a> has unanimously passed the Colorado legislature and is awaiting signature into law by Governor Jared Polis. In Nebraska, <a href="https://nebraskalegislature.gov/bills/view_bill.php?DocumentID=46901" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Legislative Bill 1000</a> already went through a legislative hearing in the Judiciary Committee and is pending a vote. And in South Carolina, <a href="https://www.scstatehouse.gov/billsearch.php?billnumbers=288&amp;session=124&amp;summary=B" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Senate Bill 288</a> has been introduced and is pending in committee. </p>



<p>
<strong>Halting Bad Legislation, Too</strong>
</p>



<p>
<strong>Fourth, ParentalRights.org works to oppose dangerous legislation.</strong> We are pleased to report that a <a href="https://www.wvlegislature.gov/bill_status/bills_history.cfm?INPUT=3099&amp;year=2022&amp;sessiontype=RS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dangerous grandparent visitation bill in West Virginia</a> that would have stripped parental rights from the law has died in committee. While we recognize the incredible role that loving grandparents and great-grandparents play in their grandchildren’s lives, not every situation is ideal, and state law must respect the decisions of fit parents. And a dangerous <a href="https://www.legislature.ohio.gov/legislation/legislation-summary?id=GA134-HB-529" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">curriculum transparency bill in Ohio</a> that inexplicably requires private and homeschools to publish their curriculum has stalled and is going nowhere.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>These victories are because moms, dads, grandparents, and other champions of parental rights across the nation have read our action alerts, picked up the phone, called your state legislators, or otherwise put in the time and effort to shape the laws of our nation. Together, we are hard at work in state legislatures across the nation to support these efforts, and the results have been incredible!</p>

<![CDATA[<p>We are excited to let you know that Colorado State Representative Tonya Van Beber has introduced <a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb22-1236" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">H.B. 22-1236</a>, The Parent’s Bill of Rights, to protect children in Colorado!</p>



<p>Representative Van Beber was joined by the following cosponsors: State Senator Don Coram, and State Representatives Richard Holtorf, Stephanie Luck, Mike Lynch, Patrick Neville, Rod Pelton, Andres Pico, Kim Ransom, and Janice Rich.</p>



<p>While Colorado already has codified as public policy in the state that parental rights are fundamental (Colo. Rev. Stat. § 13-22-107(1)(a)(III), enacted in 2003), <strong>H.B. 22-1236 will give teeth to Colorado’s existing law by stating: </strong>“The state, any political subdivision of the state, or any other governmental entity or institution shall not infringe upon the  fundamental right of a parent to direct the upbringing, education, and health care of the parent’s minor child without demonstrating that the compelling governmental interest, as applied to the minor child involved, is of the highest order, is narrowly tailored, and cannot be accomplished in a less restrictive manner.”<strong> </strong>In addition, the bill would also do the following:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Protect the parents’ right to “direct the upbringing, education, and health care” of their child;</li>
<li>Protect the parents’ right to “make health care decisions” for their child;</li>
<li>Allow parents to protect their children’s privacy in public schools, as well as opt their child out of school data collection or certain school classes; and</li>
<li>Provide a host of additional protections for families in Colorado.&amp;nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>H.B. 22-1236 has been scheduled to be heard before the <a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/content/health-insurance-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Colorado House Health &amp; Insurance Committee</a> on Wednesday, March 23, at 1:30 PM.</p>



<p>
<strong>Please call or email (or both!)</strong> your <a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/find-my-legislator" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Colorado State Representative</a> and ask him or her to support H.B. 22-1236.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Your message can be as simple as:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Please support H.B. 22-1236, the Parent’s Bill of Rights. This critical and timely bill will strengthen existing Colorado law that parental rights are a fundamental right, as the U.S. Supreme Court has held for the past 100 years. Additionally, H.B. 22-1236 will protect the right of parents to make critical decisions regarding the education, health care, and upbringing of their own children, and to protect their children’s privacy in Colorado’s public schools.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>If you decide to email your State Representative, feel free to <strong>link to <a href="https://parentalrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ParentalRights.org-letter-in-support-of-CO-Parents-Bill-of-Rights.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the letter</a> of support</strong> that we sent to the sponsor and cosponsors of H.B. 22-1236. </p>



<p>Thank you for standing with us to protect parental rights.</p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>



<p>Will Estrada</p>

<![CDATA[<p>We are excited to let you know that Minnesota State Senators Andrew Matthews, Bruce Anderson, Paul Gazelka, Michelle Benson, and Mark Koran have introduced <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bills/text.php?number=SF3064&amp;version=0&amp;session=ls92&amp;session_year=2022&amp;session_number=0&amp;format=pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">S.F. 3064</a> to protect parental rights in Minnesota! A companion bill, <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bills/bill.php?f=HF3444&amp;y=2022&amp;ssn=0&amp;b=house" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">H.F. 3444</a>, has been introduced in the Minnesota House.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>
<strong>S.F. 3064 and H.F. 3444 will enshrine into Minnesota law that parental rights are a fundamental right.</strong> In addition, these bills would also do the following:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Protect children by preserving the right of parents to have “informed consent in making health care decisions for the minor child including the choice of health care team and the right to accept or decline biological, pharmaceutical, and supplemental interventions in coordination with the selected health care team;”</li>
<li>Protect the right of parents to direct the education and upbringing of the parents’ child;</li>
<li>Ensure that parents are able to protect their children’s privacy, including personally identifiable information and biometric data, in public schools; and</li>
<li>Provide a host of additional protections for families in Minnesota.&amp;nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>If S.F. 3064 or H.F. 3444 were to be enacted into law, <strong>Minnesota would join fourteen other states</strong> in the nation that already have similar laws protecting parental rights as a fundamental right.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>
<strong>Please call or email (or both!) your Minnesota State Senator and your Minnesota State Representative and ask them to support</strong> S.F. No. 3064 in the Senate and H.F. 3444 in the House. You can find your legislators <a href="https://www.gis.lcc.mn.gov/iMaps/districts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Your message can be as simple as:</p>



<p>“Please support S.F. No. 3064/H.F. 3444, the Parents’ Bill of Rights. These critical and timely bills will enshrine into Minnesota law that parental rights are a fundamental right, as the U.S. Supreme Court has held for the past 100 years. Additionally, S.F. No. 3064 and H.F. 3444 <strong>will protect children by preserving the right of parents to make critical decisions regarding the education, health care, and upbringing of their own children</strong>, and to protect their children’s privacy in Minnesota’s public schools.”</p>



<p>Thank you for standing with us to protect children by preserving parental rights.</p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>

<![CDATA[<p>We are excited to let you know about a good bill that is moving through the Iowa State Senate, <a href="https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation/BillBook?ga=89&amp;ba=SF%202335" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">S.F. 2335.</a> <strong>This bill will protect children by requiring documented consent by a parent or guardian before the immunization or vaccination of a minor.</strong>
</p>



<p>This bill is important because we are fighting bills across the nation, and even a <a href="https://parentalrightsfoundation.org/dc-minor-consent-case/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">law recently passed by the District of Columbia</a>, allowing minors to “consent” to vaccinations without their parents even knowing about it. Such bills force children to take on adult responsibilities by <strong>robbing them of their loving parents’ wisdom in major health care decisions</strong>, such as vaccine administration.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>And they endanger children. A minor child may not know his or her medical history. A minor child could suffer an adverse reaction, and if the parent does not know that the child was immunized, they may miss warning signs and be unable to get the child to the hospital in time. Or, a parent may not know that their child received an immunization at school, and have their family pediatrician administer the same immunization, resulting in potential harm due to multiple and unnecessary doses.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>S.F. 2335 will safeguard Iowa families against all of these dangers.</strong>
</h2>



<p>S.F. 2335 passed out of the Human Services Committee <a href="https://www.legis.iowa.gov/docs/publications/SJNL/20220217_SJNL.pdf#page=16" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by an 8-5 vote on February 17</a>, and is currently pending on the Iowa State Senate Floor.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>
<strong>Please </strong>
<a href="https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislators/find" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
<strong>call or email (or both!) your Iowa State Senator</strong>
</a>
<strong> </strong>and ask him or her to support S.F. 2335. Your message can be as simple as the following:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Please support S.F. 2335, a bill which requires parental consent before a minor receives a vaccination or immunizations. This bill protects parental rights and protects children. Parents are a child’s greatest advocate and protection when it comes to making health care decisions, including immunizations and vaccinations, for their own children.”</p>

<![CDATA[<p>We’re excited to let you know that two important bills will be heard in executive session in the New Hampshire House of Representatives’ Children and Family Law Committee on Tuesday, March 1.</p>



<p>The Committee will vote on <a href="https://legiscan.com/NH/text/HB1612/id/2461636" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">H.B. 1612</a>, a bill that will change New Hampshire’s child abuse and neglect reporting laws from anonymous to confidential. This critical bill will<strong> protect innocent children and families from going through the trauma of an unnecessary governmental investigation</strong> and will ensure that the Division of Children, Youth and Families (DCYF) can <strong>focus on investigating true instances of child abuse and neglect. </strong>The bill will also create penalties for someone who knowingly makes a false report of child abuse. </p>



<p>The Committee will also vote on <a href="http://gencourt.state.nh.us/bill_status/pdf.aspx?id=28327&amp;q=billVersion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">H.B. 1431</a>, the Parents’ Bill of Rights, which will&amp;nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>
<strong>enshrine into New Hampshire law that parental rights are a fundamental right, </strong>
</li>
<li>provide curriculum transparency to parents of children in New Hampshire public schools, and </li>
<li>provide additional protections for families in New Hampshire. </li>
</ul>



<p>We encourage you to <strong>email all the members of the House Children and Family Law Committee</strong> by sending an email to <a href="mailto:CFL@leg.state.nh.us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CFL@leg.state.nh.us</a> </p>



<p>Here is a suggested email, but we encourage you to add in your own words, share personal anecdotes, and make changes so it comes from your heart:</p>



<p>Dear Members of the New Hampshire House Children and Family Law Committee:&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>As one of your constituents, I ask that you support H.B. 1612 and H.B. 1431. Both of these bills will protect children and families in New Hampshire.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>H.B. 1612 will change New Hampshire’s reporting of child abuse and neglect from anonymous to confidential. It will protect innocent children and families from going through the trauma of an unnecessary governmental child abuse or neglect investigation. Instead of pursuing false reports, New Hampshire’s Division for Children, Youth and Families will now be able to focus on investigating true instances of child abuse and neglect. Finally, H.B. 1612 will create penalties for false reports of child abuse, further protecting innocent children and families. This bill will keep bad actors from weaponizing the system against innocent families.</p>



<p>H.B. 1431, the Parents’ Bill of Rights, will enshrine into New Hampshire law that parental rights are a fundamental right, as the U.S. Supreme Court has held for the past 100 years. Additionally, H.B. 1431 will protect parents and children in New Hampshire’s public schools by allowing parents to make critical decisions regarding their own children. Passage of this bill into law will make New Hampshire the 15<sup>th</sup> state in the nation to protect parental rights as a fundamental right in the state code.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>You can read our letter of support for <a href="https://parentalrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ParentalRights.org-letter-in-support-of-NH-H.B.-1431-The-Parents-Bill-of-Rights.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">H.B. 1431 here</a> and our letter of support for <a href="https://parentalrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ParentalRights.org-letter-to-Rep.-Spillane-in-support-of-HB-1612.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">H.B. 1612 here.</a>&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you for standing with us for freedom.</p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>



<p>Will Estrada</p>

<p>
<strong>S.B. 866 is another attack on our families. </strong>It forces children to take on adult responsibilities by robbing them of their loving parents’ wisdom in major health care decisions, such as vaccine administration.</p>



<p>
<strong>
<em>And it endangers children. </em>
</strong>A minor child may not know his or her medical history. A minor child could suffer an adverse reaction, and if the parent does not know that the child was immunized, they may miss warning signs and be unable to get the child to the hospital in time. Or, a parent may not know that their child received an immunization at school, and have their family pediatrician administer the same immunization, resulting in potential harm due to multiple and unnecessary doses.</p>



<p>
<strong>Please call or email (or both!) your <a href="https://findyourrep.legislature.ca.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">California State Senator</a> </strong>and ask him or her to oppo<strong>se S.B. 866.</strong> Your message can be as simple as the following:</p>



<p>
<em>“Please oppose S.B. 866, a bill which allows minors to consent to vaccinations. This bill threatens parental rights and endangers children. Parents are a child’s greatest advocate and protection when it comes to making health care decisions, including immunizations, for their own children.”&amp;nbsp;</em>
</p>



<p>We encourage you to<strong> forward this email to several of your friends.</strong> We can win this battle for parental rights if all of us as parents stand together. The Parental Rights Foundation is litigating in federal court a similar law recently passed in the District of Columbia, and you can read our arguments against that law <a href="https://parentalrightsfoundation.org/dc-minor-consent-case/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Thanks to YOUR phone calls and emails, last week the South Dakota State House of Representatives passed South Dakota State Representative <a href="https://sdlegislature.gov/Legislators/Profile/3983/Detail" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sue Peterson’s</a> parental rights bill, <a href="https://sdlegislature.gov/Session/Bill/23092" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">H.B. 1246,</a> by an overwhelming vote of 63-5!</p>



<p>H.B. 1246 is now pending before the <a href="https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/234203.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">South Dakota State Senate Judiciary Committee</a>, and <strong>a vote could come as early as Thursday, February 24.</strong>
</p>



<p>Please email your <a href="https://sdlegislature.gov/Legislators/Find" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">South Dakota State Senator</a> as soon as possible <em>today</em> and ask him or her to support H.B. 1246. </p>



<p>Your message can be as simple as:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Please support H.B. 1246, An Act to establish the fundamental right of a parent. This critical and timely bill passed the South Dakota House of Representatives by an overwhelming vote of 63-5 and will enshrine into South Dakota law that parental rights are a fundamental right, as the U.S. Supreme Court has held for the past 100 years. H.B. 1246 will protect parents and children in South Dakota, allowing parents to make critical decisions regarding their own children.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When you email your State Senator, please feel free to link to <a href="https://parentalrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ParentalRights.org-letter-in-support-of-SD-H.B.-1246-parental-rights-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the letter</a> that we sent in support of H.B. 1246.</p>



<p>We strongly support this bill. If H.B. 1246 were to be passed into law, <strong>it would enshrine into South Dakota law that parental rights are a fundamental right.</strong> This is the exact type of legislation that is ParentalRights.org’s top priority to pass into law.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>If H.B. 1246 were to be enacted into law, South Dakota would <strong>join fourteen other states</strong> in the nation that already have similar laws protecting parental rights as a fundamental right.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you for standing with us to protect parental rights.</p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>



<p>Will Estrada</p>

<![CDATA[<p>We’re excited to let you know that Senators Ben Hansen (R – District 16), Justin Wayne (D – District 13), and Terrell McKinney (D – District 11) have introduced <a href="https://nebraskalegislature.gov/FloorDocs/107/PDF/Intro/LB1000.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">L.B. 1000</a>, a bill that protects innocent families from being caught up in child neglect investigations.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>
<strong>L.B. 1000 has been scheduled for a Judiciary Committee hearing on March 3, and we need your help. </strong>Please visit <a href="https://nebraskalegislature.gov/bills/view_bill.php?DocumentID=46901" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://nebraskalegislature.gov/bills/view_bill.php?DocumentID=46901</a> and click on the text box that says “Submit Comments Online for LB1000.” We encourage you to do this and share any stories you may have of personal issues you have had with reasonable parenting decisions being treated as neglect, reasonable parenting decisions you have been too scared to do based on a fear that someone would hotline you for neglect, or any other reason for why you support this bill.</p>



<p>For background, <strong>L.B. 1000 amends Nebraska law to clarify that a parent who allows his or her child to engage in “independent activities” will not be considered to have neglected the child</strong>, unless there is evidence of obvious danger that any reasonable parent would not – and should not — ignore. L.B. 1000 enjoys broad bipartisan support from advocacy groups across the political spectrum, including ParentalRights.org, the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) (whose model bill Nebraska’s legislation mirrors), Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA), Americans for Prosperity (AFP), Nebraska Appleseed, 50Can, Let Grow, and several Nebraska-based child advocacy groups.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>At a time when it seems that government is encroaching more and more on loving parents and their ability to care for and raise their children, <strong>L.B. 1000 protects the freedom of parents to let their children grow and thrive</strong>, freeing Nebraska’s Division of Children and Family Services to focus attention on children who are truly in danger of abuse or neglect.</p>



<p>You can see the letter of support that we sent to the sponsors of L.B. 1000 <a href="https://parentalrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-NE-in-support-of-LB-1000.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you for standing with us for parental rights and freedom.</p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>



<p>Will Estrada<br>President, ParentalRights.org</p>

<![CDATA[<p>On Tuesday night, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/02/16/san-francisco-school-board-members-recalled-00009240" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
<strong>parents in San Francisco</strong>
</a>
<strong> stunned the nation when they recalled three of their school board members in a landslide.</strong> This election result in San Francisco vindicated our argument just a few weeks ago that <a href="https://www.dailysignal.com/2022/01/19/parents-are-winning-thats-why-the-far-left-is-turning-us-into-bogeymen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">parental rights are bipartisan</a>.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>While ParentalRights.org was not involved in the San Francisco recall, we are proud of our supporters and parents in San Francisco who sent this strong message that our public schools should be focused on providing the best education for our children. And we have had some significant victories ourselves, as well!</p>



<p>First, in South Dakota, our president, <strong>Will Estrada, testified last week in favor of House Bill 1246, to protect parental rights as a fundamental right.</strong> You can listen to the sponsor of the bill, Representative Sue Peterson, and Will Estrada testify in favor of the bill <a href="https://sdpb.sd.gov/sdpbpodcast/2022/hju20.mp3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>, starting at 3:30. The bill passed the House Judiciary Committee unanimously, and on Tuesday passed the South Dakota House of Representatives in <a href="https://sdlegislature.gov/Session/Bill/23092" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">overwhelming fashion, 63-5!</a> It now goes to the South Dakota Senate for consideration. We will be working with the sponsor and our friends in the South Dakota Senate to pass it there and send it to South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem for her signature.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Passage of H.B. 1246 into law will make South Dakota the 15th state in the nation to protect parental rights as a <a href="https://parentalrightsfoundation.org/fundamental-parental-rights/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fundamental right</a> in state code.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Second, Will Estrada testified this week before New Hampshire’s House Children and Family Law Committee in favor of <a href="http://gencourt.state.nh.us/house/legislation/billinfo.aspx?id=1143&amp;sy=" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">House Bill 1612</a>, <strong>a bill that will change reporting of child abuse and neglect from anonymous to confidential.</strong> In addition to Will, Representative James Spillane and numerous New Hampshire parents also testified in favor of the bill. You can read more about the importance of this bill <a href="https://parentalrightsfoundation.org/confidential-reporting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> and <strong>listen to our podcast discussing this issue, airing on March 1.</strong>&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Third, <strong>we are working with a coalition of Colorado organizations from across the political spectrum to support </strong>
<a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb22-1090" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
<strong>House Bill 22-1090</strong>
</a>
<strong>, “Reasonable Independence for Children.”</strong> This bill will protect innocent families by changing Colorado’s neglect laws to specify that certain parental decisions <em>are not neglect</em>. H.B. 22-1090 unanimously passed out of committee on February 11 and is currently pending on the House floor. Thank you to all of our Colorado supporters who contacted your representatives in support of<a href="https://parentalrightsfoundation.org/reasonable-independence" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> this important bill!</a>
</p>



<p>These victories are just the beginning. It’s because of you and your support that we are able to fight alongside parents all across the nation. Stay tuned for more exciting updates as this “Year of the Parent” legislative season continues!</p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>

The bill will also create penalties for someone who knowingly makes a false report of child abuse.</p>



<p>H.B. 1612 will be heard before the New Hampshire State House of Representatives <a href="http://gencourt.state.nh.us/house/committees/committeedetails.aspx?id=24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Children and Family Law Committee</a> <em>tomorrow, February 15, at 10:30 AM</em>. Our President, Will Estrada, is flying to Concord to testify in favor of the bill.</p>



<p>
<strong>Please contact </strong>
<a href="https://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/house/members/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
<strong>your New Hampshire representative</strong>
</a>
<strong> and ask him or her to support H.B. 1612.</strong> You can call or email (or both!) your representative with a message as simple as the following:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Please cosponsor and vote for H.B. 1612. This critical and bipartisan bill will protect innocent children and families from going through the trauma of an unnecessary governmental child abuse or neglect investigation. Instead of pursuing false reports, New Hampshire’s Division for Children, Youth and Families will now be able to focus on investigating true instances of child abuse and neglect. Finally, H.B. 1612 will create penalties for false reports of child abuse, further protecting innocent children and families.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>If you decide to email your representative, <strong>feel free to </strong>

<p>We are grateful for H.B. 1612’s sponsors, Representatives James Spillane, Terry Roy, Alan Bershtein, Alicia Lekas, Ellen Read, and Senator Kevin Avard, for introducing this critical piece of legislation. <strong>This legislation is based on a </strong>

<![CDATA[<p>We are excited to let you know that <em>not one, but two</em> <strong>parental rights bills have been introduced in the Georgia State House of Representatives!</strong>
</p>



<p>
<a href="https://legiscan.com/GA/text/HB1158/id/2504096/Georgia-2021-HB1158-Introduced.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">H.B. 1158</a> and <a href="https://legiscan.com/GA/text/HB1178/id/2504042/Georgia-2021-HB1178-Introduced.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">H.B. 1178</a> would both enshrine into Georgia law that parental rights are a fundamental right. Either bill would also do the following:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>provide curriculum transparency to parents of children in Georgia public schools,&amp;nbsp;</li>
<li>allow parents to protect their children’s privacy in public schools,&amp;nbsp;</li>
<li>allow parents to opt their children out of certain public-school classes, and&amp;nbsp;</li>
<li>provide a host of additional protections for families in Georgia.&amp;nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>While both bills protect parental rights as fundamental, <a href="https://legiscan.com/GA/text/HB1158/id/2504096/Georgia-2021-HB1158-Introduced.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">H.B. 1158</a> is the stronger bill, because it specifically authorizes parents to direct the “health care” of their minor children. It also includes allows parents to exempt their minor children from immunizations.</p>



<p>If either H.B. 1158 or H.B. 1178 were to be enacted into law, Georgia would join fourteen other states in the nation that already have similar laws protecting parental rights as a fundamental right.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>
<strong>Please call or email (or both!)</strong> your <a href="https://www.legis.ga.gov/find-my-legislator" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Georgia State Representative</a>, and ask him or her to support H.B. 1158 and H.B. 1178.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Your message can be as simple as:</p>



<p>“Please support H.B. 1158 and H.B. 1178, the Parents’ Bill of Rights. These two critical and timely bills will enshrine into Georgia law that parental rights are a fundamental right, as the U.S. Supreme Court has held for the past 100 years. Additionally, H.B. 1158 and H.B. 1178 will protect parents and children in Georgia’s public schools, allowing parents to make critical decisions regarding their own children.”</p>

<![CDATA[<p>“If California is ever going to achieve true equity, <strong>the state must require parents to give away their children</strong>. … My solution—<strong>making raising your own children illegal</strong>—is simple…”&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>So said Joe Matthews, a columnist for the Ventura County Star, in an opinion piece published on January 13, 2022. His opinion piece was republished a few days later in the San Francisco Chronicle, amplifying this extreme position. (Read my response to his shocking article <a href="https://townhall.com/columnists/williamestrada/2022/01/24/no-california-should-not-abolish-parenthood-in-the-name-of-equity-n2602280" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.)</p>



<p>Today’s threats to parental rights aren’t coming from the United Nations, since treaties require a two-thirds vote in the Senate to be ratified (although we must always be vigilant to dangerous international treaties that would replace our nation’s history of parental rights as a fundamental right with the nebulous “best interests of the child” standard).&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Today’s threats to parental rights also aren’t necessarily coming from the courts (although the Parental Rights Foundation and our allies are vigorously fighting in state and federal courts to protect parental rights).&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>No, many of today’s threats to parental rights are coming from <strong>academics trying to reshape our cultural worldview around their own distorted vision of the family.</strong> And through their attempts to reshape our nation’s cultural worldview, they hope to—in time—reshape the legal and political landscape in a way that forever destroys parental rights.</p>



<p>These academics include Professor James Dwyer from William and Mary University, who <a href="https://parentalrightsfoundation.org/the-state-assigns-legal-parentage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">famously said</a> <strong>parental rights are given by the government, conferred through a birth certificate</strong>. And, of course, what government gives, government can take away—or even withhold in the first place.</p>



<p>There’s also Elizabeth Bartholet of Harvard University, who <a href="https://parentalrights.org/harvard-magazine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opined that</a> <strong>homeschooling (and most private schools) should be illegal so that all children receive the same brand of education,</strong> the inculcation of one uniform worldview. (That would, of course, be the worldview held by Bartholet herself, and Dwyer, and—apparently—Joe Matthews, as well.)</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>Seizing the Moment</strong>
</h2>



<p>
<strong>Clearly, our work is cut out for us.</strong> This is no time to rest. Rather, we have decided to seize the moment and work across the nation to introduce and pass state fundamental parental rights statutes.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>In December of last year, I flew out to San Diego for the annual conference for the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC). We’ve been working with ALEC and the state legislators and outside groups there to get this language approved as a model bill:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>
<em>Section 1. The liberty interest of a parent in the nurture, education, care, custody, and control of the parent’s child is a fundamental right recognized by the United States Constitution and the Constitution of the State of ___________.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>Section 2. No agency or officer of this state nor any agency or officer of any subdivision of this state shall infringe fundamental parental rights except as provided by law narrowly tailored to meet a compelling governmental interest by the least restrictive means.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The language in Section 1 comes straight from the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in <em>Troxel v Granville</em>, 530 U.S. 57, 65 (2000): “<strong>The liberty interest</strong> at issue in this case—<strong>the interest of parents in the care, custody, and control of their children</strong>—is perhaps the oldest of the <strong>fundamental </strong>liberty interests recognized by this Court” (bolding added). In that <em>Troxel</em> decision, the Supreme Court cites a long line of seminal cases, including <em>Meyer v. Nebraska</em> (1923), <em>Pierce v. Society of Sisters</em> (1925), and <em>Wisconsin v. Yoder</em> (1972), that have consistently recognized parental rights as fundamental rights. And now we’re working to enshrine this judicial precedent in state legislation across the nation to provide an extra level of protection to the fundamental right of loving parents—not bureaucrats or academics—to direct the nurture, education, care, custody, and control of their children.</p>



<p>I’m pleased to tell you <strong>this model parental rights bill was accepted unanimously.</strong> And then the <em>real </em>work began.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Working with our state parental rights coordinators and state legislators, we started introducing the model parental rights bill in state legislatures in the past few weeks. We followed the model that we used in Florida last year, when Florida passed their incredibly strong state parents’ bill of rights.</p>



<p>
<strong>Permit me a moment to highlight three states where these efforts are already underway.</strong>
</p>



<p>First, our model parental rights bill has been introduced in <strong>Pennsylvania</strong>. On January 4, Senators Doug Mastriano, Kristin Phillips-Hill, Judy Ward, and Michele Brooks introduced the parental rights statute, <a href="https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billInfo/billInfo.cfm?sYear=2021&amp;sInd=0&amp;body=s&amp;type=b&amp;bn=996" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">S.B. 996</a>, following our model legislation. We’re working with them and with parents from across the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to get the bill scheduled for a committee hearing and a vote. This is our year to see it passed into law.</p>



<p>Our model parental rights statute has also been introduced in <strong>South Dakota</strong>. <a href="https://sdlegislature.gov/Session/Bill/23092" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">H.B. 1246</a> was introduced by Representatives Sue Peterson, Aaron Aylward, and Carl Perry, and Senator Jessica Castleberry on January 27, 2022. It is being heard in the House Judiciary Committee today, February 9, and our president, Will Estrada, is presenting testimony in that hearing to support this bill that protects fundamental parental rights.</p>



<p>Finally, our model parental rights statute has been introduced in <strong>New Hampshire</strong>. On January 5, <a href="https://legiscan.com/NH/bill/HB1431/2022" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">H.B. 1431</a> was introduced by Representatives Paul Terry, Jeffrey Greeson, John Potucek, Richard Littlefield, Gregg Hough, Mark Alliegro, Aidan Ankarberg, Dawn Johnson, Norman Silber, and Melissa Blasek, and Senator Bob Giuda. Not only does it protect parental rights, but New Hampshire’s H.B. 1431 also includes strong curriculum transparency provisions, in addition to protecting the fundamental right of parents.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>
<strong>But these are not all; the list goes on and on.</strong>&amp;nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>Historic Opportunity for Parental Rights</strong>
</h2>



<p>
<strong>We are seeing a level of interest in parental rights issues that is unparalleled in our 15-year history.</strong> Last year, we were successful in passing the Florida Parents’ Bill of Rights. But this year, we’re looking at multiple states passing parental rights legislation. And that presents a powerful opportunity!</p>



<p>But the reason we are able to rise to this challenge and seize the moment as the only nationwide organization solely devoted to advancing, defending, and protecting the rights of parents, is because of your partnership and generosity.</p>



<p>
<strong>Will you stand with us at this critical moment for parental rights?</strong> Will you stand with the moms and dads who spent last year speaking out at school board meetings, and who are now working to advance this promising, pro-family, and pro-freedom legislation?&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>We have a crucial need to increase our staff to support moms and dads in all 50 states. But we can only grow through your support.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Will you take a moment today to<strong> <a href="http://parentalrights.org/donate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">send your best gift </a>
</strong>of $25, $60, or even $100 to expand our reach into additional states with the family-protecting security of a fundamental parental rights statute?</p>



<p>
<strong>Your partnership will make all the difference in this vital effort nationwide.</strong>
</p>



<p>Thank you for standing with us to protect children by defending the rights of parents in every possible state!&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>



<p>
</p>



<p>William A. Estrada, Esq.</p>



<p>President<br>ParentalRights.org and the Parental Rights Foundation</p>



<p>PS: In addition to our focus on state parental rights bills, we’re also working to reform state CPS laws to protect innocent parents and children, insert due process in child abuse and neglect investigations, advance curriculum transparency bills so parents know what is being taught in their public schools, and reintroduce our federal Parental Rights Amendment to the US Constitution. In addition to our legislative work, we have our ongoing litigation in state and federal courts to protect parental rights. And we’ve been publishing op-eds in news outlets around the country to advocate for parental rights in the public square. We’ll have more updates about all of this work in future letters!</p>

<![CDATA[<p>The month of February marks the 15-year anniversary of ParentalRights.org. <em>Because of you</em> and your generosity—with financial support, grassroots action, volunteering, calling or emailing your state and federal legislators, and more—we as an organization can celebrate 15 years of protecting children by empowering parents.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>
<strong>It’s been a team effort, and we’re just getting started.</strong>
</p>



<p>Over the month of February, we’ll be marking the milestone. But the best way we can mark our 15th anniversary is by doing even more to fight for and defend the right of loving parents to raise, educate, and nurture their children.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>And that’s what we’ve been doing. <strong>January has been one of our busiest months ever.</strong>
</p>



<p>At the federal level, we worked with US Senator James Lankford (OK) on a <a href="https://www.lankford.senate.gov/news/press-releases/lankford-colleagues-champion-parents-rights-in-education" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
<strong>resolution that he released for National School Choice Week</strong>
</a>. We applaud Senator Lankford for his leadership for school choice and parental rights in education.</p>



<p>
<strong>We are working with state legislators in four states that introduced fundamental parental rights bills based on our model</strong>: <a href="https://parentalrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/PRO-letter-re-MO-HB-1995.docx-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
<strong>Missouri</strong>
</a>, <a href="https://parentalrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-NH-PRO-letter-in-support-of-HB-1612.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
<strong>New Hampshire</strong>
</a>, <a href="https://parentalrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ParentalRights.org-letter-in-support-of-PA-S.B.-996-parental-rights.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
<strong>Pennsylvania</strong>
</a>, and <a href="https://parentalrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ParentalRights.org-letter-in-support-of-SD-H.B.-1246-parental-rights.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
<strong>South Dakota</strong>.</a> (We’re about to add Rhode Island and Hawaii to this list!) If these states were to pass their fundamental parental rights bills, it would bring to eighteen the number of states across the nation that protect parental rights as a fundamental right in state law!</p>



<p>We sent letters of support to state legislators in <strong>three states that introduced legislation to protect parents from facing child neglect investigations simply for allowing their children to have reasonable independence</strong>: <a href="https://parentalrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ParentalRights.org-letter-in-support-of-CO-H.B.-22-1090.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
<strong>Colorado</strong>
</a>, <a href="https://parentalrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-NE-in-support-of-LB-1000.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
<strong>Nebraska</strong>
</a>, and <a href="https://parentalrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ParentalRights.org-letter-in-support-of-SC-S-288.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
<strong>South Carolina</strong>
</a>. We’re joined in this effort by organizations across the political spectrum, including Lenore Skenazy’s fantastic organization, <a href="https://letgrow.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
<strong>Let Grow</strong>
</a>.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>We sent a letter of support to state legislators in <a href="https://parentalrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ParentalRights.org-letter-to-Rep.-Spillane-in-support-of-HB-1612.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
<strong>New Hampshire</strong>
</a> who introduced legislation to <strong>change reporting of abuse or neglect from anonymous to confidential</strong>, to protect innocent families from unnecessary and potentially traumatic government investigations.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>
<strong>We are working with the </strong>
<a href="https://www.aclupa.org/en/legislation/hb-1737-compelled-drug-screening" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
<strong>ACLU of Pennsylvania</strong>
</a> to oppose <a href="https://parentalrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ParentalRights.org-Opposition-to-HB-1737-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
<strong>a dangerous bill</strong>
</a> that will threaten Pennsylvania parents with involuntary drug or alcohol testing in the course of certain abuse or neglect investigations.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>We are <a href="https://parentalrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ParentalRights.org-letter-opposing-WV-HB-3099.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
<strong>opposing a dangerous bill in West Virginia</strong>
</a> that <strong>removes current protections for parents from state law </strong>in the context of grandparent-visitation controversies.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>We stood up for the right of private educational institutions to be free of government mandates<strong> <a href="https://parentalrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ParentalRights.org-letter-regarding-OH-HB-529.pdf">by sending a letter to a legislator in Ohio</a>
</strong> who introduced a curriculum transparency bill that would have applied to private and homeschools. And our Parental Rights Foundation joined with a coalition of organizations from across the political spectrum <a href="https://parentalrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Group-Letter-Opposing-CPS-Handbook-Revisions-to-mail-PRF.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
<strong>in urging the State of Texas to rescind guidelines</strong>
</a> that make it harder for families to have support during abuse or neglect investigations.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>At the same time, we’re stepping up our efforts to defend parental rights in the public square. We were able to publish op-eds responding to attacks on parental rights in<strong> <a href="https://www.dailysignal.com/2022/01/19/parents-are-winning-thats-why-the-far-left-is-turning-us-into-bogeymen/?fbclid=IwAR28QN1j5LDTl9Qi5FuPyDqOj0leu9u5-n1hGQ0ih6IoHxbPfgJrxtig7c4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Daily Signal</a>
</strong> and in <a href="https://townhall.com/columnists/williamestrada/2022/01/24/no-california-should-not-abolish-parenthood-in-the-name-of-equity-n2602280?fbclid=IwAR2xJvAa2lwIKv-8D8d5RO1E4JBGEyJc2RSaLPfRd9dWYJEgI5B90N0M138" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
<strong>TownHall</strong>
</a>.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Yes, we’re excited about our 15th anniversary. But the stakes are just too high to rest on our laurels. <strong>We’re just getting started.</strong> And from the bottom of my heart, <em>thank you</em> for standing with us as we work to protect children by empowering parents.</p>



<p>Sincerely yours,</p>



<p>Will Estrada<br>President, ParentalRights.org</p>

<![CDATA[<p>We’re excited to announce that Pennsylvania Senators Doug Mastriano, Kristin Phillips-Hill, Judy Ward, and Michele Brooks have <strong>introduced </strong>
<a href="https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billinfo/billinfo.cfm?syear=2021&amp;sind=0&amp;body=S&amp;type=B&amp;bn=0996">
<strong>S.B. 996</strong>
</a>
<strong> to protect parental rights.</strong> S.B. 996 will protect parental rights in Pennsylvania law, strengthening the right of parents to direct the education, upbringing, and care of their children. And it will allow Pennsylvania to join the <em>twelve other states</em> in the nation that already have a similar law on their books.</p>



<p>Our new President, Will Estrada, and one of our Board Members, Vickie Suarez, are <strong>joining families from across Pennsylvania on Tuesday, February 8, at the Capitol Rotunda in Harrisburg,</strong> and will speak about parental rights and the importance of S.B. 996. We encourage you to attend, hear from Will Estrada and Vickie Suarez and other speakers on parental rights issues in Pennsylvania, and then visit your elected officials in person to urge them to support S.B. 996. You can click<a href="https://parentalrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Schedule-for-february-8-2022-pa-lobby-day-1.1.docx-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <strong>here</strong>
</a> to see a schedule of events on Tuesday, February 8. </p>



<p>
<strong>If you cannot make it to the Pennsylvania Capitol on Tuesday, you can still help!</strong> Please contact your <a href="https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/home/member_information/contact.cfm?body=S">Pennsylvania senator</a> and ask him or her to support S.B. 996 to enshrine into Pennsylvania law that parental rights are a fundamental right. If you send your senator an email using the online contact form, feel free to link to <a href="https://parentalrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ParentalRights.org-letter-in-support-of-PA-S.B.-996-parental-rights.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our letter </a>we sent in support of S.B. 996. Your message can be as simple as:</p>



<p>&amp;nbsp;<em>“Please support S.B. 996 to enshrine into Pennsylvania law that parental rights are a fundamental right. This common-sense bill will take the U.S. Supreme Court’s precedent from the last 100 years and put it into the text of Pennsylvania law, thereby protecting the constitutional rights of Pennsylvania families.”</em>
</p>



<p>Thank you for standing with us to fight for parental rights. We look forward to seeing you on Tuesday, February 8!</p>

<p>H.B. 22-1090 amends Colorado law to clarify that <strong>a loving and caring parent who allows his or her child to engage in “independent activities” will not be considered to have neglected the child.</strong>
</p>



<p>H.B. 22-1090 enjoys broad bipartisan support from advocacy groups across the political spectrum, including ParentalRights.org, the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) (whose model bill Colorado’s legislation mirrors), Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA), Let Grow, Elephant Circle, and several Colorado-based child and family advocacy groups.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Please contact both <a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/legislators" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">your senator and representative</a> and ask them to support H.B. 22-1090. You can call or email (or both!) your senator and representative with a message as simple as the following:</p>



<p>“Please support H.B. 22-1090 to provide children with reasonable independence. At a time when it seems that government is encroaching more and more on loving parents and their ability to care for and raise their children, H.B. 22-1090 provides freedom to parents to let their children grow and thrive, freeing the Colorado Department of Human Services’ Division of Child Welfare to focus attention on children who are truly in danger of abuse or neglect.”</p>



<p>If you decide to email your representative and senator, feel free to link to <a href="https://parentalrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ParentalRights.org-letter-in-support-of-CO-H.B.-22-1090.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the letter</a> that we sent to the sponsors of H.B. 22-1090. </p>

<p>L.B. 1000 amends Nebraska law to clarify that <strong>a parent who allows his or her child to engage in “independent activities” will not be considered to have neglected the child</strong>, unless there is evidence of obvious danger that any reasonable parent would not – and should not — ignore.</p>



<p>L.B. 1000 enjoys broad bipartisan support from advocacy groups across the political spectrum, including ParentalRights.org, the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) (whose model bill Nebraska’s legislation mirrors), Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA), Americans for Prosperity (AFP), Nebraska Appleseed, 50Can, and several Nebraska-based child advocacy groups.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Please <a href="https://nebraskalegislature.gov/senators/senator_find.php">contact your senator</a> and ask him or her to cosponsor L.B. 1000, and vote in support of it. You can call or email (or both!) your senator with a message as simple as the following:</p>

At a time when it seems that government is encroaching more and more on loving parents and their ability to care for and raise their children, L.B. 1000 provides freedom to parents to let their children grow and thrive, freeing Nebraska’s Division of Children and Family Services to focus attention on children who are truly in danger of abuse or neglect.”</p>



<p>If you decide to email your senator, feel free to link to the <a href="https://parentalrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-NE-in-support-of-LB-1000.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">letter</a> that we sent to the sponsors of L.B. 1000. </p>



<p>Thank you for standing with us for parental rights and freedom.</p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>

<![CDATA[<p>We’re excited to let you know that a bipartisan coalition of New Hampshire representatives has introduced <a href="https://legiscan.com/NH/text/HB1612/id/2461636">H.B. 1612</a>, a bill that will change New Hampshire’s child abuse and neglect reporting laws from anonymous to confidential. This critical bill will <strong>protect innocent children and families</strong> from going through the trauma of an unnecessary governmental investigation and will <strong>ensure that DCYF can focus on investigating true instances of child abuse and neglect</strong>.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>The bill will also create penalties for someone who knowingly makes a false report of child abuse or neglect.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>(The bill also requires that a guardian ad litem be appointed when a child is in court pursuant to a Division for Children, Youth and Families (DCYF) petition and the child’s parents are involved in divorce proceedings, but ParentalRights.org <em>does not have a position</em> on this aspect of the bill.)&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Please contact <a href="https://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/house/members/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">your New Hampshire representative</a> and <a href="https://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/senate/members/wml.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New Hampshire senator</a> and <strong>ask them to cosponsor and vote for H.B. 1612.</strong> You can call or email (or both!) your representative and your senator with a message as simple as the following:</p>



<p>“Please cosponsor and vote for H.B. 1612. This critical and bipartisan bill will protect innocent children and families from going through the trauma of an unnecessary governmental child abuse or neglect investigation. <strong>Instead of pursuing false reports, New Hampshire’s Division for Children, Youth and Families will now be able to focus on investigating true instances of child abuse and neglect.</strong> Finally, H.B. 1612 will create penalties for false reports of child abuse and neglect, further protecting innocent children and families.”</p>



<p>If you decide to email your representative, feel free to link to the<a href="https://parentalrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ParentalRights.org-letter-to-Rep.-Spillane-in-support-of-HB-1612.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> letter </a>that we sent to the sponsors of H.B. 1612.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>We are grateful for H.B. 1612’s sponsors, Representatives James Spillane, Terry Roy, Alan Bershtein, Alicia Lekas, Ellen Read, and Senator Kevin Avard, for introducing this critical piece of legislation. This legislation is based on a <a href="https://parentalrightsfoundation.org/confidential-reporting/">model bill that the Parental Rights Foundation</a> shepherded through the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) a few years ago.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you for standing with us for freedom.</p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Four West Virginia state delegates have introduced a grandparent visitation bill,<strong> <a href="https://www.wvlegislature.gov/bill_status/bills_history.cfm?INPUT=3099&amp;year=2022&amp;sessiontype=RS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">H.B. 3099</a>
</strong>, that <strong>violates U.S. Supreme Court precedent and threatens the fundamental right of parents to make decisions for their children.</strong> While I know first-hand the incredible blessing that grandparents play in my children’s lives, it must be parents, not courts, that decide who should be involved in a child’s life.</p>



<p>This dangerous bill may be up for a reading in the House as early as tomorrow, January 28, so <em>the time to act is now</em>.</p>



<p>We urge you to <a href="https://www.wvlegislature.gov/House/roster.cfm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
<strong>contact your West Virginia State Delegate</strong>
</a> and ask him or her to oppose this dangerous bill. You can read the letter that we sent to the sponsors of H.B. 3099 <strong>
<a href="https://parentalrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ParentalRights.org-letter-opposing-WV-HB-3099.docx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>,</strong> and if you decide to email your delegate, please feel free to link to our letter.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Your message can be as simple as the following:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Please oppose H.B. 3099. This dangerous bill will change current law to remove a requirement that a court consider the fundamental right of parents to raise their children before granting grandparent visitation rights over a loving parent’s objection. Parents, not courts, should make the decision of who is involved in a child’s life. West Virginia law already balances grandparent visitation with parental rights, so there is no need for this bill.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Thank you for standing with us for freedom and parental rights.</p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>

<![CDATA[<p>We need your help to stop a bad bill in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.</p>



<p>
<a href="https://www.legis.state.pa.us/CFDOCS/Legis/PN/Public/btCheck.cfm?txtType=PDF&amp;sessYr=2021&amp;sessInd=0&amp;billBody=H&amp;billTyp=B&amp;billNbr=1737&amp;pn=1968" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">H.B. 1737</a> will receive a vote in the <a href="https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/cteeInfo/Index.cfm?Code=1&amp;CteeBody=S&amp;SessYear=2021" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Senate Aging &amp; Youth Committee</a> as early as tomorrow, Wednesday, January 19. It is a short bill giving Child Welfare Services (CWS) authority to seek a court order to compel parents to undergo drug and alcohol testing in certain abuse and neglect investigations. It sounds like a good bill. But in practice, it would be used by CWS case workers <strong>to pressure parents to submit to a drug or alcohol testing in <em>any</em> investigation</strong> meeting the requirements of the bill, even if it’s merely <strong>an anonymous and false allegation from an irate neighbor or grumpy relative.</strong> This bill increases the power of CWS at the expense of families and children and is unnecessary. CWS has plenty of power to investigate allegations of child abuse and neglect without this bill.</p>



<p>ParentalRights.org is partnering with organizations in Pennsylvania from across the political spectrum to defeat this bill. You can see <a href="https://parentalrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ParentalRights.org-Opposition-to-HB-1737-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our letter here</a>, and the letter from the ACLU of Pennsylvania <a href="https://www.aclupa.org/en/legislation/hb-1737-compelled-drug-screening" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. </p>



<p>Please <a href="https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/home/member_information/contact.cfm?body=S" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">contact your Pennsylvania senator</a> (via either phone or the online contact form) and <strong>ask them to <em>oppose</em> H.B. 1737.</strong> If you send your senator an email using the online contact form, feel free to link to our letter and the ACLU of PA’s letter against H.B. 1737. Your message can be as simple as this:</p>



<p>&amp;nbsp;<em>“Please oppose H.B. 1737. It runs contrary to recent precedent from the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, is not necessary to protect children, and will lead to more families being turned upside down.”</em>&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you for standing with us in this fight.</p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Our team has been working nonstop with our volunteers across the nation in these first few days of 2022. Already, the hard work we all have been doing for the past months to advance parental rights is paying off!&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s a quick summary of where we are:</p>



<p>
<strong>Fundamental Parental Rights Statute Introduced in Pennsylvania.</strong> We’re excited that our model statute has been introduced in Pennsylvania as <a href="https://www.legis.state.pa.us/CFDOCS/Legis/PN/Public/btCheck.cfm?txtType=PDF&amp;sessYr=2021&amp;sessInd=0&amp;billBody=S&amp;billTyp=B&amp;billNbr=0996&amp;pn=1305" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">S.B. 996</a>. The bill declares, “The liberty of a parent to direct the upbringing, education, care and welfare of the parent’s child is a fundamental right.” ParentalRights.org strongly supports this bill. If you live in Pennsylvania, please <a href="https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/home/member_information/contact.cfm?body=S" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">call your state senator</a> and ask him or her to sign on as a cosponsor of S.B. 996.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>
<strong>Protecting Parental Rights in Missouri.</strong> State legislators in Missouri have introduced <a href="https://www.house.mo.gov/bill.aspx?bill=HB1995&amp;year=2022&amp;code=R" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">H.B. 1995</a>, a fundamental parental rights statute that protects parental rights and provides parents in public school with additional protections regarding their children. We are working with our friends at Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA) and Families for Home Education (FHE) in Missouri to tighten up some of the language in the bill. ParentalRights.org president Will Estrada sent <a href="https://parentalrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/PRO-letter-re-MO-HB-1995.docx-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a letter to the sponsor </a>and also submitted formal written testimony to the legislature yesterday. </p>



<p>
<strong>Curriculum Transparency Bills Introduced in Numerous States</strong>. ParentalRights.org generally supports bills that provide parents of children in public school with information about what their children are learning. ParentalRights.org has been monitoring numerous curriculum transparency bills that have been introduced across the nation.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>
<strong>In Ohio</strong>, a curriculum transparency bill was introduced that included homeschools and private schools. ParentalRights.org president Will Estrada and our friends at HSLDA met with the sponsors of the bill to explain how this<a href="https://parentalrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ParentalRights.org-letter-regarding-OH-HB-529.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> was not acceptable</a>, and we are grateful that the sponsors listened to our concerns.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>
<strong>In Indiana, several versions</strong> of curriculum transparency bills have been introduced, including <a href="http://iga.in.gov/legislative/2022/bills/senate/167/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">S.B. 167</a> and <a href="http://iga.in.gov/legislative/2022/bills/house/1040#document-5f566baa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">H.B. 1040</a>. (Note that these bills also touch upon issues that are outside our focus.)&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s exciting to see how the concern of parents over what their children are being taught in public schools is resulting in curriculum transparency bills being introduced in nearly every state. We are reviewing these critical bills and will have more updates and action alerts in the very near future.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>
<strong>Protecting innocent families in child abuse and neglect investigations.</strong> This remains one of our highest priorities. In Pennsylvania, we are working with a coalition from across the political spectrum to stop <a href="https://www.legis.state.pa.us/CFDOCS/Legis/PN/Public/btCheck.cfm?txtType=PDF&amp;sessYr=2021&amp;sessInd=0&amp;billBody=H&amp;billTyp=B&amp;billNbr=1737&amp;pn=1968" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">H.B. 1737</a>, a bill that would allow CPS to seek a court order to compel mandatory drug or alcohol testing of a parent, if just an <em>allegation</em>—even an <em>anonymous </em>allegation—is raised against a parent stating that impairment due to drug or alcohol use is a contributing cause of alleged abuse or neglect. <strong>This will expand the power of CPS officials in PA to upend families</strong> and is contrary to a recent Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision on this very issue. ParentalRights.org president Will Estrada sent a letter to Pennsylvania senators,<a href="https://parentalrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ParentalRights.org-Opposition-to-HB-1737-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> urging them</a> to oppose the bill, joining with a wide array of other organizations—including the <a href="https://www.aclupa.org/en/legislation/hb-1737-compelled-drug-screening" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ACLU of Pennsylvania</a>.</p>



<p>And we worked with a coalition of like-minded organizations to oppose a <strong>recent policy change in Texas</strong> that will make it harder for Texas parents to seek the support of “advocacy organizations, such as parent rights advocates and homeschool coalitions” when they are being investigated for alleged child abuse or neglect. (Yes, the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services actually singled out parent-rights advocates and homeschoolers!) You can read the letter that the Parental Rights Foundation sent to the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services <a href="https://parentalrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Group-Letter-Opposing-CPS-Handbook-Revisions-to-mail-PRF.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>
<strong>This is just a snapshot of what we’ve been doing in recent weeks.</strong> ParentalRights.org has also been working in over a dozen other states and at the federal level to provide technical assistance and background information as bills are being drafted. We’re excited that state and federal legislators and their staff, as well as policy makers across the nation, are seeking out our expertise as they draft bills affecting parental rights. It’s because of <strong>
<em>you</em>
</strong> that we are able to work coast to coast on parental rights issues, and we are grateful for you.</p>



<p>We encourage you to like us on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/parentalrights.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Facebook</a> and follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/parentalrights" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a> for up-to-the-minute updates on what we are doing to protect children by empowering parents. And <em>share this email</em> with any family and friends you know who share your concern for parental rights!</p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>



<p>Michael Ramey<br>Executive Director&amp;nbsp;</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Dear Parental Rights friends,</p>



<p>When I was in San Diego at the beginning of the month to present our model state parental rights statute at the American Legislative Exchange Council Summit, I also was able to get lunch with one of our donors, Steve.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Steve and his wife Cathy have been faithful and longtime donors to the cause of parental rights. They have seven children, two of whom were adopted from overseas. Like you<strong>, they know how critical protecting the fundamental right of parents is </strong>to their family, to their community, and ultimately, to our nation.</p>



<p>Steve and I hit it right off. We didn’t want our lunch to end. As we were heading back to the car, <strong>Steve asked me a question that was important enough that I wanted to share it with all of you, too. </strong>(I asked Steve to review this email, and he gave it his okay.)</p>



<p>Steve told me that he wanted to be able to go back to Cathy (she had been planning to join us but wasn’t able to at the last minute) and give her <strong>a list of the Parental Rights Foundation’s needs. </strong>He asked me what we needed by the end of the calendar year. I mentioned a few of our top needs right then and there, but <strong>I thought that Steve’s question is probably one you have, too.</strong>
</p>



<p>As you know, ParentalRights.org and our charitable arm, the<a href="http://parentalrightsfoundation.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
<strong> Parental Rights Foundation</strong>
</a>, are 100% dependent on you. <strong>The work that we’re doing in the media, in our 50 state legislatures, in the courts (both at the state and federal level), and in Congress, is only possible because of your generous donations.</strong> And we never lose sight of the fact that many of you are raising your children or grandchildren, paying for educational expenses, and have other demands on your hard-earned money. You have the deep gratitude of each and every person on staff at ParentalRights.org and the Parental Rights Foundation.</p>



<p>As you consider your year-end giving, I’ll share with you the same list I shared with Steve, as well as some additional needs:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>
<strong>Our renewal dues are coming up at the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC).</strong> We use our membership there to meet with numerous state legislators, to build relationships with allied organizations, and to advance model state statutes (like our parental rights statute, and our two model state statutes to promote due process and protections in our child welfare laws). Those annual dues are $8,500.&amp;nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Our<strong> litigation expenses </strong>are mounting. We are currently representing families in <strong>
<a href="https://parentalrightsfoundation.org/foundation-goes-to-court-september-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">federal district court Washington, DC</a>, </strong>and in state court in the<strong> <a href="https://parentalrightsfoundation.org/foundation-sues-virginia-ag-mark-herring-challenges-new-virginia-statute/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Commonwealth of Virginia</a>.&amp;nbsp;</strong>
<br>
</li>
<li>We need to hire a <strong>full-time legislative assistant</strong> who would help Michael Ramey (our Executive Director) coordinate the burgeoning number of state parental rights bills and support our volunteers who are on the ground across the nation.<br>
</li>
<li>Our <strong>donor and contacts database</strong> is state of the art, secure, and perfect for our organization. But it costs $1,400 a month to license and operate.&amp;nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>Those are some of our urgent needs. But beyond that, we have identified some of our long-term goals. If we could meet these funding goals sooner rather than later, we’d be better equipped to seize this historic moment for parental rights and<strong> achieve some long-lasting successes that will benefit parents across the nation:</strong>
</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>We are discussing <strong>an advertising campaign that will provide information to policy makers at the local, state, and federal level </strong>when they are thinking about parental rights. This advertising campaign will be scalable, meaning if we only raise $10,000, we can put it in a small online media market that will be most effective. If we raise $100,000, we can go bigger. If we raise $1,000,000, we can do an aggressive, nationwide media campaign to advance and promote parental rights. Remember, many legislative staffers and other policy makers in our nation are not parents. Providing them with talking points and reminders about parental rights will go a long way toward advancing parental rights.</li>
<li>We are constantly approached by individuals who are looking for legal help in their cases against government overreach in the area of parental rights. We are unfortunately forced to turn away most of these potential cases due to limited bandwidth.<strong> We would like to hire another full-time attorney to enable us to take on more cases and increase our reach through <em>amicus curiae </em>(friend of the court) briefs in cases regarding parental rights across the nation. </strong>To bring on a full-time skilled litigation attorney would cost between $100,000 and $150,000 a year.&amp;nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>If you would like to partner with us, you can make an end-of-year<strong> <a href="https://secure.parentalrights.org/np/clients/parentalrights/donation.jsp?campaign=3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tax-deductible donation here</a>.</strong> If you would like to make a major gift, please contact me directly at <strong>
<a href="mailto:will@parentalrights.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will@parentalrights.org</a>.</strong>
</p>



<p>Thank you for standing with us for parental rights.</p>



<p>Very truly yours,</p>



<p>William A. Estrada, Esq.</p>



<p>President, ParentalRights.org and the Parental Rights Foundation</p>

<p>It’s almost crazy to imagine that <strong>legislatures will be starting up their 2022 legislative sessions as early as this Monday!</strong> Fortunately, we are already poised to hit the ground running in several states.</p>



<p>If you were planning an end-of-year tax-deductible gift to the Parental Rights Foundation, let me remind you to <a href="http://parentalrightsfoundation.org/donate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">get that in</a> today.</p>



<p>And then, for just this one more week, catch your breath, enjoy time with family and friends, and <strong>get ready for our biggest year yet.</strong>
</p>



<p>Happy New Year from the Parental Rights Foundation and ParentalRights.org.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Today is #GivingTuesday, and it’s the one day you can double every dollar you give to ParentalRights.org or the Parental Rights Foundation.</p>



<p>That’s because generous supporters have agreed to match every dollar given, up to $45,000. That’s every dollar up to our $90,000 goal!</p>



<p>
<strong>From school boards across the country to the gubernatorial election in Virginia on November 2, the parental rights movement has gained momentum like a freight train and parents WILL NOT be stopped in 2022.&amp;nbsp;</strong>
</p>



<p>Today is the day to build that momentum even more by doubling every dollar. <strong>You give $1, the movement gains $2.</strong>
</p>



<p>So please take a moment right now to make <strong>
<a href="https://secure.parentalrights.org/forms/giving-tuesday-2021" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">your best possible gift </a>
</strong>to ParentalRights.org (not tax deductible, but can be used for political efforts like urging state senators to vote for a parental rights bill) or the <a href="http://parentalrightsfoundation.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Parental Rights Foundation</a> (cannot be used for political efforts, but is a tax deductible gift). Whichever way you give, every dollar will be matched for parental rights!</p>



<p>
<strong>Then, please urge your family and friends to get on board, too.</strong>
</p>



<p>Together we can protect children by empowering parents into 2022 and beyond!</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Tomorrow is #GivingTuesday, and your Parental Rights Foundation and ParentalRights.org are poised to make it our biggest day of giving ever!</p>



<p>This year, generous supporters have pledged to match up to $45,000 in gifts. That means that for every dollar given, ParentalRights.org or the Parental Rights Foundation will receive $2.</p>



<p>
<strong>That’s why we’ve set our one-day goal this year at $90,000—to earn 100% of those matching gifts.</strong>
</p>



<p>If we can do that, it will be our <em>largest single day of revenues ever</em>!</p>



<p>And that’s fuel for defending families like Scott and Jane in Virginia, who are prohibited by law from considering religion when hiring a babysitter to help them raise their daughter with special needs.</p>



<p>
<strong>It will fuel efforts like the one in Florida that saw the passage of the Parents’ Bill of Rights in 2021.</strong>
</p>



<p>It will fuel more model bills like the ones we have taken to the American Legislative Exchange Council to protect parental rights as fundamental, to outlaw anonymous reports to child abuse hotlines, and to provide due process before a parent’s name goes on a child abuse registry.</p>



<p>
<strong>With your support, we can continue all these efforts and do so much more!</strong>
</p>



<p>So, are you on board? Are you ready to give your best gift this #GivingTuesday?&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Even more importantly, are you ready to spread the word to your friends and family so they’ll get on board and support parental rights?&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>
<strong>Many Americans have awakened to this issue in recent months and are <em>looking for a way</em> to join this movement and make a real difference</strong> for their children and for the future.</p>



<p>
<strong>We can make that difference.</strong> Will you let them know we’re here so they can get on board, too, and be a part of our shared success in defending families?</p>



<p>Thank you for reading. I look forward to seeing what we can do together to win for families this #GivingTuesday and beyond!</p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>



<p>Michael Ramey<br>Executive Director</p>

<![CDATA[<p>As we enter this holiday season, we at ParentalRights.org and the Parental Rights Foundation have so much to be thankful for!</p>



<p>We are thankful for this year’s successes in protecting parental rights, like the <strong>new<a href="https://www.myfloridahouse.gov/Sections/Bills/billsdetail.aspx?BillId=70313" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Parents’ Bill of Rights</a> passed in Florida</strong> that went into effect on July 1. ParentalRights.org was in the forefront in passing this law, which will serve as a model for additional states in 2022.The new law was even the subject of a special session these last two weeks, as lawmakers worked to make it even stronger. We are especially thankful for Florida state coordinators Jim and Patti Sullivan, whose tireless work made this victory possible.</p>



<p>We are also thankful how your support has enabled us to file lawsuits to<strong> defend families against harmful laws in the <a href="https://parentalrightsfoundation.org/foundation-goes-to-court-september-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">courts of DC</a> and </strong>
<a href="https://parentalrightsfoundation.org/foundation-sues-virginia-ag-mark-herring-challenges-new-virginia-statute/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
<strong>Virginia</strong>.</a> While these cases are ongoing, we are proud to stand with you in protecting the right of parents to make the best medical and religious decisions as they raise their children.</p>



<p>We are thankful and so excited for <strong>the wave of interest in parental rights issues that has come out of th<a href="https://parentalrightsfoundation.org/parents-issue-wake-up-call-in-virginia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">e Virginia gubernatorial elections</a>
</strong> earlier this month. This gives us momentum we can ride (and build!) into 2022 and beyond.</p>



<p>But most of all, <strong>we are thankful for you</strong>, because without your constant support, <a href="http://parentalrights.org/donate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">financial</a> <em>or otherwise</em>, we simply would not be here to do any of this.</p>



<p>So thank you, from the bottom of our hearts, and may you have a warm and loving Thanksgiving this year!</p>



<p>–The Staff of ParentalRights.org and the Parental Rights Foundation</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>#GivingTuesday</strong>
</h2>



<p>Giving Tuesday, the day set aside to “give back” by supporting the charity of your choice, is the Tuesday after Thanksgiving. <strong>That’s November 30 this year, and <em>it’s just one week away!</em>
</strong>
</p>



<p>This year, supporters have generously agreed to match donations made to the Parental Rights Foundation or ParentalRights.org on that day, up to a match of $45,000. So we have set our goal to meet 100% of their match—a total of $90,000!</p>



<p>That means every dollar given will count as $2 toward our $90,000 goal.</p>



<p>But we can only reach it with your help. <strong>Please plan now both to give and to spread the word to your family and friends. </strong>“Parental rights” is a big issue throughout the country right now, and we are <em>the only nationwide organization dedicated entirely to securing and protecting these rights.</em>
</p>



<p>
<strong>So tell all your friends, and let’s prepare both our organization and our movement for the biggest year yet in 2022!</strong>

<![CDATA[<p>We are pleased to announce that on November 29, 2021, <strong>William A. Estrada, Esq., will be joining the Parental Rights Foundation (PRF) and ParentalRights.org as our first-ever full-time president.&amp;nbsp;</strong>
</p>



<p>ParentalRights.org founder Mike Farris served in a part-time capacity from 2006 until 2017, when he became president and CEO of Alliance Defending Freedom. Jim Mason succeeded him, also part-time, in addition to being Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA) vice president. Jim will be joining the PRF board as chairman, and Michael Ramey will continue as executive director.</p>



<p>
<strong>This is an exciting time of opportunity for the issue of parental rights, for our&amp;nbsp;organization, and, most importantly, for every single one of you who cares so deeply about this issue. </strong>All across the country, parents and policy makers are becoming attuned to the issues we care about, especially in the area of education. Now is our moment to be on the leading edge of protecting children by empowering parents all across our nation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>President’s Bio</strong>
</h2>



<p>Will served as a legal assistant with HSLDA starting in 2004 while attending Oak Brook School of Law. After he passed the California bar, Will rose to be HSLDA’s director of federal relations. He left in 2018 to work at the US Department of Health and Human Services, where he became a career employee in the Conscience and Religious Freedom Division within the Office for Civil Rights. He is a member of the California Bar, the District of Columbia Bar, and the US Supreme Court bar.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>While at HSLDA, <strong>Will worked hard to support key initiatives of our organization, such as reforming state child welfare laws and agencies across the country.</strong> Reforming that system has been a high priority for Parental Rights, and Will plans to address this issue head-on. While at HSLDA, Will also played a key role in defeating US ratification of a United Nations treaty that threatens parental rights.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>
<strong>Will plans to hit the ground running and will be introducing a model parental rights statute at the American Legislative Exchange Council on December 2.</strong> ALEC’s model bills can be adopted by state legislators all across the country.</p>



<p>Will and his wife Rachel live in Northern Virginia with their two sons, Dominic and Merrick. He is excited to be joining Parental Rights and working with Michael Ramey and the rest of the team, the board, and every single one of you who have been with us from the beginning to protect and advance parental rights. He can be reached at Will@ParentalRights.org.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>“The parents here did exactly what medical professionals ask a new parent to do: if you find something strange with your infant, report it.” So wrote New Orleans Juvenile Judge Mark Doherty in a recent case <strong>that nevertheless put two innocent young parents on the state’s child abuse registry.</strong>
</p>



<p>Specifically, new mother Tess Strickland noticed a bruise on her newborn’s head that occurred simply from adjusting his head on a breastfeeding pillow. So she contacted the pediatrician and began noting any such concerning marks.</p>



<p>A blood test came back negative, but the concerned mother continued to monitor until the baby’s eight-week checkup. That’s when the pediatrician asked if there were still marks.</p>



<p>When Tess told her there were and shared what she had observed, the doctor’s response was horrifying. <strong>“She said she had to report us for child abuse,”</strong> the mother told local news station <a href="https://www.wdsu.com/article/new-orleans-child-abuse-investigation/38093445" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WDSU in this report</a>. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>Child Abuse System “A Sham”</strong>
</h2>



<p>The next day, DCFS came to the family home with two New Orleans detectives. A little later, after interviewing the parents separately, the detectives left, having found no abuse.</p>



<p>
<strong>But DCFS plays by a different rulebook all their own.</strong>
</p>



<p>They instructed the family to have the baby checked by a child abuse pediatrician, which the family did. And that doctor concluded, because there was “no known etiology,” that the bruising was caused by abuse.</p>



<p>“No known etiology” simply means they don’t know what caused the bruising. <strong>And since they can’t point to anything else, they conclude it must have been abuse.</strong> It is a diagnosis not based on the evidence, but <em>literally based on the lack of any evidence.</em>
</p>



<p>The next day, based on this “diagnosis,” DCFS took the baby away.</p>



<p>Yet, only days before, an ER physician had named a reason for the bruising: capillary fragility, a condition that renders an infant prone to bruise too easily.</p>



<p>A week later, the couple were before the judge quoted at the beginning of this article, who ordered the child returned home. “There is no physical or testimonial evidence in this case against the parents,” he wrote in his opinion, adding, <strong>“This is a system which borders on a sham.”</strong>
</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>Innocent—Yet on the List?</strong>
</h2>



<p>Unfortunately for this young family, though, their nightmare was not over. Instead, two months after their child was returned to them, they received a letter from DCFS notifying them that their names were being added to the state’s registry of child abusers.</p>



<p>
<strong>It’s “like a nightmare that won’t end,”</strong> the father, Chris, told WDSU in their report.</p>



<p>But it is all too common.</p>



<p>Yes, even when the parents have been found “not guilty” of any criminal charges. Even when the family court judge orders the baby returned, declaring that the home is safe.</p>



<p>
<strong>The system is deeply flawed, preventing most parents from getting any kind of legal due process until after their name has been added to the roll.</strong>
</p>



<p>At least in Louisiana, it looks like their names are not added until their appeal is waived or concluded. Chris and Tess won their appeal, so their names never actually went on the list. But this is not the norm in every state. And the harm to families is real.</p>



<p>Attorney Andrew Brown of the Texas Public Policy Foundation (TPPF) is an ally of the Parental Rights Foundation, working together to bring reform in this area. Andrew was also quoted in the WDSU report<strong>: “When you separate a child from their family, you are guaranteed to cause trauma to that child</strong>, even if it’s just for a week.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>Addressing the Problem</strong>
</h2>



<p>That’s why we drafted a model bill to provide due process <em>before</em> a parent’s name goes on the list. It’s why we introduced that model to the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) in 2019 and secured their endorsement of it.</p>



<p>It’s why we supported the work of Brown’s TPPF to bring that model to fruition in Texas during the 2021 session. And it’s why <strong>we’re gearing up to introduce similar legislation in additional states in 2022.</strong>
</p>



<p>If you know a lawmaker willing to champion such a bill, send them the model (<a href="https://parentalrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Central-Registry-Reform-Model-Legislation-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">available online here</a>) as a starting point. Then email <a href="mailto:Michael@ParentalRights.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Michael@ParentalRights.org</a> and let me know who you’ve reached out to (and, ideally, any response you receive).</p>



<p>
<strong>You can also aid our effort with a donation to <a href="http://parentalrights.org/donate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ParentalRights.org here.</a>
</strong> Partner with us to protect families and establish the right of due process in this otherwise “sham” of a process.</p>



<p>Together, we can protect parents like Tess and Chris from going on child abuse registries. Innocent parents have enough to worry about just raising their children; they don’t belong on abuse registries for doing nothing wrong.</p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>

<![CDATA[<p>A bill currently before Congress is threatening to shift even more control over your children to government bureaucrats.</p>



<p>The current multi-trillion-dollar budget bill that President Biden named <strong>the “American Families Plan” includes a “universal pre-k” early education program that will give the government more influence over children as young as 3.</strong>
</p>



<p>In the immediate, the plan provides billions of dollars in subsidies to government-approved pre-k programs for 3- and 4-year-olds. And while there’s nothing that says your local pre-k has to become “government approved,” most of them will do so for a slice of that money.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s why it’s there: Politicians are using our tax dollars to bribe the schools to become what the government wants them to be, whether or not it’s what the parents want or the children need. </p>



<p>The plan also provides subsidies for parents who put their children in a pre-k program —but, again, it has to be a government-approved program<strong>. This money won’t be available for parents whose beliefs compel them to put their children in a religious or other school that won’t jump through the right hoops.</strong>&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>And of course it won’t be available for families taking care of, teaching, and training their own children at home.</p>



<p>These are the immediate effects of the bill, which will lead to a greater influence by bureaucrats over the next generation, whether that includes your children or not.</p>



<p>Starting out, “government approved” may just require having an appropriate student-to-teacher ratio and the right number of fire exits. But ask parents in Loudoun County, Virginia, how far “government approved” can go.</p>



<p>Let me put it this way: government, whether state or national, has a tendency to start programs as experimental or “pilot” programs, <strong>then to make them universal (pre-k would be at this step now), then finally mandatory.&amp;nbsp;</strong>
</p>



<p>There is no guarantee that pre-k for 3-year-olds will become mandatory. That’s a provision that is <em>not included in this bill</em>. But this bill certainly paves the way for a mandate further down the line.</p>



<p>We oppose bills like this that will increase the role of government in your children’s lives. <strong>We believe that when it comes to your child, <em>you know better than the bureaucrats</em>.</strong>
</p>



<p>That’s why we helped secure a Parents’ Bill of Rights in Florida this year (and another in Oklahoma a few years back). And it’s why we secured a parental rights bill in Virginia in 2013 that has been getting attention in that state’s gubernatorial race.</p>



<p>
<strong>“A parent has a fundamental right to make decisions concerning the upbringing, education, and care of the parent’s child.” </strong>That’s the entire “meat” of the Virginia law. It is short, sweet, simple, and apparently still a point of much debate.</p>



<p>
<strong>This is the ideological battleground: Are children better cared for by their parents, who know them best and can raise them in accordance with their family’s beliefs and values?</strong> Or are they better off under experts and professionals who have studied children, curricula, and the theories of early childhood education?</p>



<p>Although the leadership and platform of one particular political party seem to be aligned with this latter view—that bureaucrats and government experts know best—it is not simply a partisan issue.</p>



<p>
<strong>We are allied with Independents, Republicans, and Democrats who soundly believe that families are vital building blocks of society, and that parents—not government agents—are best suited to know and do what is best for their child.</strong>
</p>



<p>So whatever party usually gets your vote, they need to know you stand with parents. They need to know you support the “fundamental right” of parents “to make decisions concerning the upbringing, education, and care of [their] child.”</p>



<p>Funding government involvement in the lives and minds of our little ones at younger and younger ages is not just a bad idea. <strong>It’s a threat to our families and to our futures.</strong>
</p>



<p>Standing together, we can push back and make both parties take notice that <em>parents must be respected.</em>
</p>



<p>Thank you for standing with us as we gear up to send this message loudly and clearly in the upcoming legislative session!</p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>

<![CDATA[<p>On October 4, Attorney General Merrick Garland issued a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/ag/page/file/1438986/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">memorandum</a> regarding “Partnership among federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial law enforcement to address threats against school administrators, board members, teachers, and staff.”</p>



<p>The one-page memo does not include any evidence of what it calls “a disturbing spike in harassment, intimidation, and threats of violence against school administrators, board members, teaches, and staff….” Nor does it mention any <em>actual acts</em> of violence.</p>



<p>
<strong>In the absence of any such stories in the news, one is left to wonder whether the AG might refer to the increase over recent months in the number of angry parents showing up at school board meetings across the country to express opposition to certain agenda items and programs that schools are foisting on their children.&amp;nbsp;</strong>
</p>



<p>Since the COVID-19 pandemic sent our school children home for their education, more and more parents have become concerned over the things their children were—or were not—learning. Now that schools are returning to in-person education, many of those parents want to make sure the disturbing things they saw and heard do not continue in their child’s classroom. </p>



<p>
<strong>It is a fundamental right of parents to direct the education of their children,</strong> and it is a fundamental right of all Americans to express their views and to petition their government—including their local school boards—for a redress of grievances.</p>



<p>If the memo means to address actual threats or acts of violence, it would have done well to outline some of those events.</p>



<p>Instead, it comes across as a closely veiled threat against parents who express concerns over what their children are learning in their local public schools.</p>



<p>Ironically, if that is in fact the case, then <strong>the parents are doing exactly what they should do by taking their concerns to the appropriate local, public forum set up for that purpose.</strong> The Department of Justice, on the other hand, would be out of line, suggesting federal action over local concerns for which the DOJ has no legal jurisdiction.</p>



<p>
<strong>Any criminal act of violence that occurs at a school board meeting or over a disagreement in school policy would rightly be handled by the local police or sheriff, not the FBI.</strong>
</p>



<p>All of this gives the memo the look of a veiled threat to parents: “sit down and shut up, or we will label you ‘domestic terrorists’ and open an FBI investigation on you.”</p>



<p>Now, again, that may not be the aim of the memo at all (though, if it is not, its actual aim completely escapes me).</p>



<p>But in any case, the appropriate thing for parents to do is to continue speaking up and speaking out, but taking care to do so without any threat of violence or other criminal activity.</p>



<p>Yes, your school boards and administrators work for you. Yes, they should answer to you. And many of them have <em>completely lost sight of that fact.</em> But you do not need to threaten them to hold them to account. <strong>It is enough to know your rights and assert them.</strong>
</p>



<p>Of course, we know you already know that. But we are concerned by the perception that this memo seeks to raise the stakes.</p>



<p>We will continue to monitor this situation for any developments or clarifications.</p>



<p>Thank you for standing with us as always to defend your children by defending our parental rights.</p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>

<![CDATA[<p>
<em>Note: this article was originally published as an email by<a href="https://hslda.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> HSLDA.</a> </em>
</p>



<p>Late Tuesday night, former Virginia governor and current gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe communicated one of the most radical policies I’ve heard from a mainstream politician in over a decade.<br>
<br>When asked why he vetoed a bill requiring parental involvement in school library resource selection, he stated:<br>
<br>“I’m not gonna let parents come into schools and actually take books out and make their own decisions… I don’t think parents should be telling schools what they should teach.”<br>
<br>Last we checked, it was the civic duty of the governed to tell their elected representatives (like school board members) what they should and shouldn’t do. <br>
<br>When politicians start saying things like this, no one should be surprised that parents reject this totalitarian perspective and flock to the banner of educational freedom and homeschooling. <br>
<br>Don’t take our word for it. . . . We have included the link to the portion of the debate here: <a href="https://go.hslda.org/e/795273/Mcok-vGxYnA-t-1706/39473q/379272331?h=Pe-JH3EXBVEo2CgY-dEkk-MmVZ4CxStK4dunXZ3s7FE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Virginia Gubernatorial Debate 2021 </a>
<br>
<br>Context does not make this better. If possible, it makes it worse. You can read our full thoughts on the subject in our <a href="https://go.hslda.org/e/795273/-surrounding-state-run-schools/39473s/379272331?h=Pe-JH3EXBVEo2CgY-dEkk-MmVZ4CxStK4dunXZ3s7FE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">article</a>, but here are our main takeaways: <br>
<br>First: Homeschooling has been growing at an astronomical rate since the beginning of the pandemic. This is in no small part because parents are finally discovering what their children’s educational environments are really like.  Educational freedom is critical and offers these responsible and loving parents the opportunities that they need in order to do what is best for their children. This is something that must be maintained. <br>
<br>Two: Leaders who believe parents shouldn’t have a say in public school education are doubting parent’s decision-making ability. This idea will not confine itself to public schools but will seep into all education policy. Indeed, all policy altogether. This is deeply concerning, and we, as citizens, must stand up and oppose it. <br>
<br>Three: The mission of HSLDA Action, HSLDA’s sister organization that’s dedicated to public advocacy for homeschooling freedom, is more important than ever. Action’s goal is to protect and advance homeschool freedom in the political arena, and that is just what is needed right now. When you have mainstream politicians opposing basic, fundamental rights, you need someone in office to oppose them. Even if you’re already an HSLDA member, please consider joining HSLDA Action, and help them work on behalf of your rights as homeschoolers, and support candidates who will do so.  </p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>



<p>James R. Mason<br>President</p>

<![CDATA[<p>According to national figures, nearly <strong>3.5 million children are the subject of a Child Protective Services (CPS) investigation each year.</strong> Only 17% of these investigations result in a finding of abuse or neglect.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>In 83% of these cases, the investigation is closed as unfounded or unsubstantiated.</p>



<p>
<strong>Among anonymous reports to child abuse hotlines, that number soars to over 90%.</strong>
</p>



<p>That’s a lot of innocent families facing the trauma of a child abuse investigation. And that’s a lot of resources, which could be spent finding and helping children in actual need, being wasted on chasing down false reports, instead.</p>



<p>Not that all anonymous reports are knowingly false, of course. But that anonymity certainly makes it easier for an angry ex or a disgruntled family member or neighbor to use CPS as a weapon against an innocent family.</p>



<p>We’ve even heard of cases where <em>a police officer or a judge</em> became the subject of an investigation because a criminal they had dealings with made an anonymous report.</p>



<p>That’s why the Parental Rights Foundation this year focused our efforts on drafting<strong> <a href="https://parentalrightsfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Confidential-Reporting-Model-Legislation-PRF.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a model bill</a> to halt anonymous reports to child abuse hotlines and replace them with confidential reports</strong>, instead.</p>



<p>I am thrilled to report that <strong>our model was unanimously adopted by the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), the largest gathering of conservative state lawmakers in the country, on July 28.</strong>&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>This is an exciting victory for the Foundation, but it means nothing until ParentalRights.org rises to the challenge of identifying lawmakers and volunteers to bring the model to their own state legislatures in 2022.</p>



<p>Make no mistake: <strong>this is tremendous news.</strong> The unanimous vote at ALEC is a major win for our legislative policy efforts, giving full conservative support to what we are looking to accomplish.</p>



<p>Thisis a golden opportunity to make <em>a real and lasting change</em> for America’s families.</p>



<p>
<strong>But to meet the challenge before us now will require all the resources we can muster.</strong>
</p>



<p>The endorsement by ALEC last month opens the door for us to gather support from a lot of conservative lawmakers—lawmakers like <strong>Rep. Kim Moser of Kentucky</strong>.</p>



<p>Last December, Rep. Moser heard about our bill at a preliminary meeting of ALEC, intended to lead up to this July’s vote. But Rep. Moser decided she didn’t need to wait. She didn’t need ALEC’s endorsement to know this was a bill she believed in.</p>



<p>So she contacted us, adjusted our language for her state as needed, and proposed it to her legislature. By March 1, <strong>the Kentucky House had passed the measure unanimously, 96-0.</strong>&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>(Unfortunately, it stalled in the Senate later that month, but only after clearing the Health &amp; Welfare Committee. It was one floor vote away from final passage.)</p>



<p>Rep. Moser will take up the bill again in January.</p>



<p>But in order to have others do as she has done, we have to reach them in the next few months.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s because many states require that bills be pre-filed in November or December to be considered in the session starting in January.</p>



<p>And that means <strong>we are challenged <em>right now</em> with reaching lawmakers—and volunteers—with the important message that this change is necessary to protect families.</strong>
</p>



<p>The reform is simple: under our model bill, state law would require anyone calling a child abuse hotline to leave their name and identifying information when they make a report of abuse. <strong>Their information would still be kept confidential, but it would no longer be completely anonymous.</strong>
</p>



<p>The point of this is simple: to cut out knowingly false reports currently made by the thousands who <strong>“weaponize”</strong> the child welfare system. Such calls are made anonymously all the time, by a jilted ex, or a jealous family member, or a vindictive neighbor.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Even by criminals, as I mentioned above.</p>



<p>
<strong>It’s just too easy: Make one anonymous phone call, and turn an innocent family’s life upside down.</strong>
</p>



<p>When Jim presented our model to the committee at ALEC<strong>, one of the lawmakers present—someone we did not know and hadn’t spoken to beforehand—rose to tell his story.</strong>&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Before he was in the legislature, he was an executive in an office. During one difficult period, he was part of the leadership team who had to make cuts, including deciding who should stay and who should go.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Because he had concerns about one particular employee, he mentioned that perhaps that one should be let go.</p>



<p>The next thing you know, the future lawmaker was the subject of a ridiculous child abuse investigation rising from <em>one anonymous call</em>.</p>



<p>In his case, though, the employee boasted about what he had done, and ended up getting caught. <strong>The whole thing was cleared up and the lawmaker’s innocence proven. But that took time—time when his family was still stressed, probed, and traumatized.</strong>
</p>



<p>Needless to say, that lawmaker fully supports our bill.</p>



<p>Yet, while preserving innocent families is reason enough to champion this measure, our effort isn’t only about them. It’s also about protecting children in need.</p>



<p>See, such calls waste the resources of a child welfare system already spread too thin. <strong>By cutting out these false reports, we can free up those resources to find and help the children who really do need assistance.</strong>
</p>



<p>It’s a vital reform to protect innocent families <em>and</em> point “the system” in the direction it was meant to go in the first place.</p>



<p>And with ALEC’s endorsement, <strong>we are now in a terrific position to bring it to the states starting this January.</strong>
</p>



<p>But we won’t be able to do that without your support.</p>



<p>So please take a moment right now<a href="http://parentalrights.org/donate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> </a>to make<a href="http://parentalrights.org/donate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <strong>your best investment </strong>
</a>of $10, $25, or even $125 to preserve families by protecting parental rights through these vital efforts.</p>



<p>
<strong>This is a crucial moment, a vital window of opportunity that is only open for <em>a few short weeks</em>.</strong>
</p>



<p>Can I count on you to fuel our effort to end anonymous reports to child abuse hotlines through your generous gift today?&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>And let me add: If you care about these issues as much as I know you do, <strong>please share this message with your family and friends and urge them to get involved as well.</strong>
</p>



<p>Together we can protect children by empowering parents through this simple reform.</p>



<p>Thank you for standing with us now, as always.</p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>

<strong>It is time to <em>take action!</em>
</strong>
</p>



<p>As I reported last week,<strong> the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) voted unanimously to adopt our model bill to end anonymous reports to child abuse hotlines, </strong>replacing them with confidential reports instead.</p>



<p>That makes right now—and these next 2-3 months—the ideal time to reach out to your state lawmakers and <strong>ask them to champion this bill in the upcoming 2022 legislative session.</strong>
</p>



<p>Many states have pre-filing requirements, which means a bill must be filed in November or December to be considered when the session starts in January. So even though 2022 seems a long way off, the time to get started is <em>now.</em>
</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>ALEC and the Strength of Our Model Bill</strong>
</h2>



<p>
<strong>ALEC is the largest gathering of conservative state lawmakers in the country, </strong>with more than 500 legislators attending this year’s conference. So if you have a conservative state representative (or assemblyman or delegate) or senator, there’s a very good chance ALEC’s endorsement of the bill will be important for them to know.</p>



<p>And if your lawmakers are Democrats, ALEC’s endorsement will mean they should have no trouble getting assistance and support from across the aisle.</p>



<p>The model itself, which will require your state’s child abuse hotline to get personally identifying information from anyone calling in a child abuse report, should be<strong> appealing to those on both sides of the aisle.&amp;nbsp;</strong>
</p>



<p>As it stands, <strong>anonymous reporting can be used to “weaponize” the child welfare system. </strong>With a single anonymous phone call, an angry ex, a jilted lover, or a jealous family member can wreak havoc on the lives of an innocent family. Their spite will waste the time and resources of an already-overworked system that could have been spent finding and addressing actual abuse instead.</p>



<p>By requiring identifying information from those who call, your state can greatly reduce the number of knowingly false calls, freeing up those resources—and those innocent families, as well.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>What to Do Now</strong>
</h2>



<p>
<strong>To take action, simply download the model bill <a href="https://parentalrightsfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Confidential-Reporting-Model-Legislation-PRF.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here,</a> then email it to your state senator or representative and ask them to please consider championing this measure in the coming session.&amp;nbsp;</strong>
</p>



<p>Then, please take a moment also to email me, <a href="mailto:Michael@parentalrights.org">Michael@parentalrights.org</a>, and let me know who you’ve reached out to and in what state. That will let me coordinate efforts among volunteers in the same state. You can also feel free to ask any questions you may have along the way.</p>



<p>Of course, a lot of states still have not passed a law to provide due process before a name gets on the child abuse registry, which was addressed in our model presented to ALEC last year. You can find that model <a href="https://parentalrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Central-Registry-Reform-Model-Legislation-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> and share it with your lawmakers as well.</p>



<p>Together, we can bring positive change for America’s families, one state at a time.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>
<strong>Let’s get started in <em>your </em>state, shall we?</strong>
</p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Friday signed a law that will protect families from unnecessary separation on the opinion of a single child abuse pediatrician. At the same time, the Florida legislature sent its Parents’ Bill of Rights to Governor Ron DeSantis for his signature, which is expected at any time.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>Listen to the Second Opinion</strong>
</h2>



<p>In 2016, Texas mother Ann Marie Timmerman rushed her 4-month-old baby to the hospital due to lethargy, where she learned he was experiencing a small amount of bleeding on his brain. <strong>It’s the kind of injury child abuse pediatricians are trained to believe can only be caused by abuse, and that was the “diagnosis” passed on to Texas Child Protective Services (CPS), who removed the child from his parents’ care.</strong>
</p>



<p>A pediatric neurosurgeon believed—and reported—that the injury was probably a normal result of the childbirth. But neither CPS nor the family court judge paid any attention to what he had to say, and the family was separated for months before the baby was finally returned home.</p>



<p>Not surprisingly, the Timmermans were among those who testified before the Texas legislature to get this new law passed. Their story appears in <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/new-texas-law-aims-protect-parents-wrongly-accused-child-abuse-n1271646" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this article</a> at NBC News.</p>



<p>
<strong>Under the new law, </strong>
<a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/87R/billtext/pdf/SB01578F.pdf#navpanes=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
<strong>Senate Bill 1578</strong>
</a>
<strong>, both CPS and the judge will be required to consider this second opinion before they can decide to remove the child from his or her parent(s).</strong> The law goes into effect on September 1.</p>



<p>This is wonderful news, because child abuse pediatricians’ findings are very often in conflict with the findings of the <em>real</em> experts—those whose medical specialties focus on the very body part or system that has suffered trauma. In the case of the Timmermans, for instance, it is incredible to imagine that a pediatric neurosurgeon could not diagnose a brain injury better than a doctor who spends more time in a courtroom than in an operating room.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>It Happens All the Time</strong>
</h2>



<p>In her book, <em>They Took the Kids Last Night: How the Child Protection System Puts Families at Risk</em>, Diane Redleaf chronicles the trauma done to a Chicago family because <strong>CPS believed a child abuse pediatrician regarding a broken bone, ignoring the expert testimony of a radiologist and a pediatric orthopedist (x-ray and bone experts, respectively).</strong> Fortunately, the family court judge got that one right—eventually.</p>



<p>And in <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/doctors-wisconsin-hospital-call-changes-amid-backlash-over-child-abuse-n1131151" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another article</a> we covered back in March of last year, another child abuse pediatrician in Wisconsin was credited over the protests of multiple hematologists (blood experts), over something that turned out to be—you guessed it—a blood condition.</p>



<p>
<strong>The fact is, such events happen all the time, with CPS going along with the “diagnosis” from child abuse pediatricians because, after all, “they’re the experts.”</strong> Except they’re not really experts in medicine at all. They are experts in “diagnosing” abuse—the only diagnosis they ever render—and in presenting their findings in family court.</p>



<p>Finally, Texas is opening the door for common sense to accompany these cases into the courtroom. By including the voice of more focused medical experts in the child-removal consideration, this law will protect countless families from the kind of overreach that so traumatized the Timmermans and the others mentioned above.</p>



<p>
<em>To hear more about good laws passed in Texas this session, check out my discussion with Texas Public Policy Foundation’s Andrew Brown on this week’s episode of the </em>EPPiC Broadcast<em> podcast.</em>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>Florida Parents’ Bill of Rights Reaches Governor’s Desk</strong>
</h2>



<p>
<strong>In Florida, meanwhile, the Parents’ Bill of Rights has finally been signed by the officers of the House and Senate and is now on the governor’s desk.</strong> He is known to be a friend to this legislation, so we expect his signature at any time. Literally scores of bills were all sent to his desk at once late last week, so it could be a little while before he gets to this one, especially if he chooses to schedule a special signing ceremony to celebrate its passage.</p>



<p>But once it bears his signature, <a href="https://www.myfloridahouse.gov/Sections/Bills/billsdetail.aspx?BillId=70313" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">House Bill 241</a> will gather all Florida parental rights laws into one chapter and <strong>will safeguard the primary role of parents in the care, nurture, and education of their children.</strong>&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you for being partners in our work and in these tremendous successes in Texas and Florida.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<![CDATA[<p>It happened so fast, coalition colleague Andrew Brown referred to it as a “fire drill.”</p>



<p>Last Monday afternoon, our coalition was contacted by staff for the Senate’s Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee (called the HELP Committee): <strong>they were going to be discussing a bill to reauthorize the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA), they were open to making changes to how CAPTA works, and <em>they wanted our input on what changes they should make</em>.</strong>
</p>



<p>Oh, and could we give our response by Tuesday afternoon? The meeting was scheduled for Thursday.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>Already in the Works</strong>
</h2>



<p>Fortunately, we had been working through plans for those very changes for a couple of years now with our colleagues in the United Family Advocates coalition, so we had no shortage of ideas. And the above-mentioned Andrew Brown of the Texas Public Policy Foundation (and our podcast guest for June 22, so stay tuned!), along with Kathleen Creamer of Community Legal Services of Philadelphia, was willing to draw together our top priorities in a list of reforms the senators could easily follow and discuss.</p>



<p>Now, to understand what’s at stake, let me remind you that CAPTA is a huge part of the federal law (along with the Adoption and Safe Families Act, or ASFA) that directs the states on how to carry out their child welfare programs. If a state wants federal dollars —and they all do—they have to play by the rules laid out in CAPTA and ASFA. <strong>So putting our reforms in CAPTA is a chance to bring those changes to <em>every state</em>—if we can first just get them through Congress.</strong>
</p>



<p>And that starts with the Senate HELP Committee.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>Our Priorities to Protect Innocent Families</strong>
</h2>



<p>Some of our top organizational priorities of the last couple of years made the list: <strong>stop confusing “poverty” with “neglect;” keep innocent parents off central registries for child abuse and neglect;</strong> and don’t separate children from their parents without a court order unless there are actually exigent circumstances.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>We added several other good reforms, too.</p>



<p>The first we added is related to one of my personal “pet peeves,” the power of child abuse pediatricians to “diagnose abuse,” even when other medical experts have perfectly reasonable, evidence based, non-criminal diagnoses that explain the injuries or illness just as well. A safeguard to protect families in such instances made the list.</p>



<p>
<strong>Another concern I have is the frequency with which newborns are separated from their mothers by child welfare agencies with no evidence of abuse or neglect</strong>, simply because they are born with a drug in their system. Vitally, this includes the very drugs doctors routinely prescribe for mothers with prior substance addictions who are determined to “get clean” for their new bundle of joy. It is actually safer for both mother and child if the mom is on this “withdrawal aid” than if she quits “cold turkey”—that is, until the baby is born and tested and child welfare is notified. Our letter included a recommendation for fixing that problem in CAPTA, too.</p>



<p>These are just five of the reforms we proposed. You can <strong>see the full three-page report with all ten priorities</strong> of the United Family Advocates coalition (of which your Parental Rights Foundation is a part)<a href="https://parentalrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/United-Family-Advocates-S.-1927-CAPTA-Reform-Proposals.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> here.</a>
</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>Did They Listen?</strong>
</h2>



<p>It was an honor to lend advice to the U.S. Senate on how to reform child welfare through federal law. And it gives us hope that they are at least considering the plight of these families.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>But it will be weeks or even months before we know how effective it was.</p>



<p>That’s because first the committee will make edits to the existing bill based on the suggestions they like, whether from us or from other interested groups they heard from. Once they release their edits, we’ll better know if they were listening to us.</p>



<p>But then their bill will have to be reconciled with a House bill on the same CAPTA reauthorization, and the bills frankly don’t look much alike. (We were able to share suggestions to the House sponsors, too, but were disappointed in how little they listened to what we had to say.)&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Next the question becomes whether any of our suggestions, if they even make it into the Senate bill in the first place, will survive their discussion with the House.</p>



<p>So, <strong>the future of these bills and our proposed reforms is uncertain. But it’s much better to be invited to the table and asked to speak than to be left out in the cold.</strong> That is not the only hurdle, but it is often the biggest hurdle—and it’s the one we have already overcome.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Now we wait with cautious optimism to see what the HELP Committee makes of our suggestions.</p>



<p>Thank you for standing with us through the years and putting us in a position to bring about the change our families need in the child welfare system today!</p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>



<p>Michael Ramey<br>Executive Director </p>

<em>Minnesota citizens rally in 2019 to oppose a change in state law that would have limited their choices as parents.</em>
</span>
</p>

	



	
		
	


	
						
		

			
	
	
		
	<p>Unfortunately, we were right.</p>
<p>Last fall when DC was considering a bill authorizing minors as young as 11 to consent to vaccines without their parents’ knowledge or consent, we warned that if the effort passed, it would soon be copied in the states as well.</p>
<p>That bill was passed over our objections, and <strong>last week, lawmakers in Minnesota proved our prediction correct.</strong>
</p>
<p>On Thursday, May 15, Rep. Freiburg and Sen. Eaton introduced identical bills, <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bills/text.php?number=HF2625&amp;type=bill&amp;version=0&amp;session=ls92&amp;session_year=2021&amp;session_number=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">House File 2625</a> (H.F. 2625) and  <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bills/bill.php?f=SF2553&amp;y=2021&amp;ssn=0&amp;b=senate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Senate File 2553</a> (S.F. 2553), to <strong>allow doctors to secure legally binding consent for vaccination from minors as young as 14—even younger if the doctor claims the child is ready</strong> <strong>to make such a decision</strong>.</p>
<p>Sometimes I <em>really do</em> hate to say, “I told you so.”</p>
<h2>
<strong>Conflict of Interest</strong>
</h2>
<p>These bills are concerning for several reason, regardless of one’s opinion of the vaccines themselves.</p>
<p>First, there’s the inherent conflict of interest. The law allows doctors to give the vaccination to children as young as 12<strong> “upon determination <em>by the health care provider proposing to administer the vaccine</em> that the minor is capable of consenting to the proposed vaccine”</strong> (emphasis added).</p>
<p>Now, there are instances when it is appropriate for a judge, as an objective third party, after considering all the evidence and circumstances, to empower a minor to make a decision on their own.</p>
<p>But under this bill, the doctor who is going to give the shot, who is <em>going to get paid for giving it</em>, gets to decide whether the child is “capable of consenting.” <strong>No, most doctors won’t prioritize financial gain over a child’s health. But that doesn’t mean the incentive isn’t there for those who do.</strong>
</p>
<h2>
<strong>Bill Robs Children</strong>
</h2>
<p>But the bigger concern is that <strong>the bill robs the child of the protections of a wiser, more experienced, wholly invested (and usually better-informed) adult: their parent.</strong>
</p>
<p>Is a 12-year-old ready to make a vaccine decision? We already have an answer to that question from the US Supreme Court, though Minnesota lawmakers don’t seem to want to hear it:</p>
<p>“Most children, even in adolescence, simply are not able to make sound judgments concerning many decisions, including their need for medical care or treatment,” the Court declared in 1979. <em>“Parents can and must make those judgments” </em>(emphasis added).</p>
<p>
<strong>The danger here is not that the bill violates parental rights per se, but that in doing so the bill puts the health or even lives of adolescents at risk.</strong>
</p>
<p>Children are not ready to track their own medical history, let alone their family medical history. They may miss warning signs, they are more prone to take unwarranted risks, and they don’t often see the big picture or all of the long-term effects of their decisions.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court knew this. Parents know it. You and I know it.</p>
<p>Truth is, most adolescents know it, too, if you give them a moment to think about it.</p>
<p>
<strong>So why can’t Minnesota’s lawmakers get it?</strong>
</p>
<p>Children are entitled to the wisdom and experience of their parents to help protect them from long-term consequences and permanent decisions they’re not ready to make.</p>
<p>So just why are lawmakers so bent on robbing our youth of these protections at such a vulnerable time?</p>
<h2>
<strong>Be Vigilant, Take Action</strong>
</h2>
<p>Regardless of your position on any particular vaccine, it is vital that we stand together on this. <strong>We must defend the right of all children</strong> to the protection that comes from their own parent’s wisdom, experience, and unique personal knowledge of that child.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there is an active community of concerned Minnesota parents already voicing concerns about these bills. <strong>If you live in Minnesota</strong>, you can reach our state coordinator Angie Gallagher <a href="mailto:minnesotavaccinefreedom@gmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> to get plugged in with this group.</p>
<p>You can <strong>also email or call your state lawmakers in both houses and urge them to oppose H.F. 2625 and S.F. 2553.</strong> (Find their contact info by putting your address in the “Who represents me?” box at <a href="https://www.leg.mn.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leg.mn.gov</a>.)</p>
<p>
<strong>And if you don’t live in Minnesota,</strong> I would urge you to stay vigilant; your state could very well be next.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Michael Ramey<br>
Executive Director</p>

<![CDATA[<p>I was sitting at my desk on a Monday morning in 2009, skimming the news for parental rights stories, when I got a call from someone I’d never met. Her name was Teri: she was a concerned mother in Oklahoma, and she had just heard then ParentalRights.org president Michael Farris on a radio show over the weekend.</p>
<p>Mike had talked on the show about impending threats to the family and to parental rights, and <strong>Teri knew she had to act</strong>. She went to church Sunday morning and cornered another church member who happened to be a former state senator. He agreed to give her five minutes of his time, but as she warmed to the topic, he ended up giving her an hour and a half—and an invitation to call him again anytime she had a question or needed ideas.</p>
<p>So that Monday morning, she was calling me. Armed with the experiential knowledge of her former-senator friend, <strong>Teri was determined to bring the parental rights battle to her state of Oklahoma.</strong>
</p>
<p>At the time, we had never done anything state specific. Our aim in those days was the Parental Rights Amendment to the US Constitution.</p>
<p>But in the weeks that followed that call, ParentalRights.org drafted our first foray into state politics, a resolution to protect parental rights. <strong>And in the months following that, Teri and her growing circle of political connections got that resolution passed.</strong>
</p>
<h2>
<strong>12 Years of Partnership</strong>
</h2>
<p>Fast-forward a dozen years to 2021.</p>
<p>In the last decade, we’ve seen more than <em>a dozen bills</em> passed in as many states to protect children by guarding their parents’ rights to raise them as they see fit.</p>
<p>
<strong>States like Nevada, Virginia, Kansas, Wyoming, and Oklahoma all have new laws on the books to protect families by supporting parental rights.</strong> And right now, <strong>we’re on the brink of adding Iowa and Florida to that list</strong>, as well.</p>
<p>
<em>[Editor’s note: Since this writing, the Parent’s Bill of Rights in Florida has passed the legislature. See our update on its passage <a href="https://parentalrights.org/florida-adopts-parents-bill-of-rights/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here.</a>]</em>
</p>
<p>Jim and Patti Sullivan are championing the Parents’ Bill of Rights in Florida. Barb Heki is coordinating lawmaker support on another fundamental parental rights bill in Iowa. And a fantastic volunteer in Indiana (who prefers to remain anonymous) sounded an instrumental alert against a dangerous bill being floated there.</p>
<p>Like Teri with our very first resolution, the heroes championing these bills are all volunteers. We share our experience with them, provide them with bill language, and otherwise support what they’re doing. <strong>But they are the boots on the ground. They are the ones bringing change to their states.</strong>
</p>
<p>And with your support, we are proud to provide them the resources they need to succeed.</p>
<h2>
<strong>The Result: Good Legislation</strong>
</h2>
<p>In recent years, we have provided model legislation to declare that parental rights are <em>fundamental</em> rights and require the highest level of judicial scrutiny when those rights are violated. We’ve also helped draft “parents’ bills of rights,” as well as more targeted bills, like those to provide due process before a name goes on a child abuse registry or to end anonymous reports to child abuse hotlines.</p>
<p>These past few months, we have been fighting hard to get the Florida and Iowa bills passed. There are no guarantees, but as it stands, <strong>we are optimistic both bills will pass to protect parents’ rights: to protect Florida and Iowa <em>families</em>.</strong>
</p>
<p>And that dangerous bill in Indiana is being dealt with, too.</p>
<p>
<strong>Frankly, it has been an exciting couple of months.</strong>
</p>
<p>The passage of the dangerous DC vaccination bill was certainly a disappointment, but it was one we anticipated. We’ve handed that problem off to the Parental Rights Foundation, who will now <strong>take that battle to the courts.</strong>
</p>
<p>But in Florida, Iowa, and Indiana, we are seeing <em>very real chances for success.</em>
</p>
<p>In Iowa, Barb managed to pull together the perfect combination of lawmakers to make parental rights a priority.</p>
<p>Senator Brad Zaun is a champion of family values and has been serving in Senate leadership for years. He has experience; he knows the ropes. He knows what has to happen and who he needs to talk to if the parental rights bill is going to pass.</p>
<p>Representative Eddie Andrews, on the other hand, is in his very first term, but has quickly established a reputation as a passionate go-getter. Rep. Andrews has readily adjusted to weathering the twists and turns a legislature can present, and he is fresh, winsome, and well-liked.</p>
<p>Between the two, Zaun and Andrews have proved the perfect team to carry our bill—the respected voice of experience, and the well-liked fresh, new face.</p>
<p>I believe that <strong>together they will see this parental rights bill to victory.</strong>
</p>
<h2>
<strong>Florida Victory: A Long Time Coming</strong>
</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, in Florida, Patti and her daughter, Abbagael have been travelling from their home in south Florida to Tallahassee to attend and testify at as many committee hearings as possible. There have been <em>six</em> such hearings, and the proposed Parents’ Bill of Rights has successfully passed every one.</p>
<p>In her closing remarks before the Florida House, where the bill passed on a 78–37 vote, Rep. Erin Grall nailed the reason for the bill, the reason we stand for parental rights.</p>
<p>Grall declared, “For adult authority figures to interfere with the parent-child relationship is wrong and should not be encouraged. It erodes the family and the authority of the parent over their minor child. And <strong>parents have been put on the sidelines for too long</strong>…<strong>Children are in crisis, and those who love them most are not even being given information about the crisis</strong>.”</p>
<p>Florida lawmakers are awake now to the reality that families need to be protected from outside interference.</p>
<p>But this victory has been <em>a long time coming</em>.</p>
<p>Last year, Patti and I watched together (well, she from Florida and I from Virginia) as the Senate Rules Committee delayed the Parents’ Bill of Rights until the final day, then dragged out their discussion until the deadline had passed.</p>
<p>It was a frustrating experience, knowing our bill, sitting right there, <strong>one vote away</strong>, was dying, and there wasn’t anything we could do about it.</p>
<p>But that makes the victory this year <em>that much sweeter</em>.</p>
<h2>
<strong>It Takes All of Us</strong>
</h2>
<p>
<strong>We couldn’t have done any of it without our volunteers. And at the risk of sounding prideful, they couldn’t have done it without us, either.</strong>
</p>
<p>But that’s really the point of this letter.</p>
<p>Volunteers like Patti and Barb are looking to us to provide model language, to discuss strategy, and even to send timely email alerts. They look to us for the resources and experience they need to take their passion for parental rights, turn it into a bill, and get that bill across the finish line.</p>
<p>And it is an absolute joy to be able to be that resource for them.</p>
<p>
<strong>Because together we are slowly but surely changing the legal landscape in favor of families.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>And we are only able to do this because of you.</strong>
</p>
<p>Your generous partnership is what frees us to be there for Patti and for Barb.</p>
<p>You allowed us to be there for Teri back in 2009, and for Adriana, Tracey, and Sam along the way. <strong>In fact, you have empowered more volunteers than I have time to list in this newsletter.</strong> Their success has been your success, and I know they would want me to thank you.</p>
<p>
<strong>So thank you.</strong>
</p>
<p>Thank you for standing with us so we can stand behind these volunteers and bring real and lasting change that protects families like yours and mine from unnecessary harm.</p>
<p>But as you know, the work is far from over.</p>
<p>For every success, every victory we win together, it seems another threat shows up. <strong>We have to keep fighting together—you, me, and our wonderful volunteers—to stop the constant attacks on our rights.</strong> Can I count on you to partner with us again, to bring these new Iowa and Florida bills across the finish line, and to make sure we see even more successes in the years to come?</p>
<p>Please take a moment today to <a href="http://parentalrights.org/donate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">send your best gift</a> of<a href="http://parentalrights.org/donate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> $25, $75, or even $180 </a>to empower volunteers like Patti and Barb in their efforts to protect parental rights in state law.</p>
<p>
<strong>Thank you for fueling our success, for the sake of families all over the country.</strong>
</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

	



	


			
	
	
		
	<p>Michael Ramey<br>
Executive Director</p>
<p>P.S. Our goal is that, one day, our presence won’t be necessary anymore. That you won’t need us or our volunteers to fight for your fundamental rights as a parent. <strong>But that day isn’t here yet, and we must keep pushing forward until it is. </strong>Will <a href="http://parentalrights.org/donate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you support our work today,</a> so that we can continue strong in the fight for parental rights?</p>

<![CDATA[<p>In our largest 2021 parental rights victory to date, <strong>the Florida legislature passed <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2021/241" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">House Bill 241</a>, the Parents’ Bill of Rights, on Thursday, April 22.</strong>
</p>



<p>The measure passed the House by a vote of 78 to 37 on April 1, while a bill with the same content,<a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2021/582" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> S.B. 582</a>, worked its way through the Senate. Each bill was amended along the way, so though they both protected parental rights, they did not match last week and would have to be reconciled.</p>



<p>So on Thursday, when S.B. 582 was up for third reading (final vote) in the Senate, sponsor Sen. Rodrigues replaced his bill with H.B. 241. That way, a favorable vote would adopt the exact same bill as the House adopted, eliminating the need to reconcile two different versions.</p>



<p>The Senate <strong>voted in favor by a 24 to 15 margin.</strong>
</p>



<p>Now the bill only needs the governor’s signature, which is expected at any time.<strong> Then it will be the law in Florida.</strong>
</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>Protecting the Good</strong>
</h2>



<p>Unlike in some other states, the Parents’ Bill of Rights in Florida<strong> isn’t so much a new law as it is a reorganizing of the good laws that are already there.</strong> It gathers the rights of parents and the limitations of government actors from other sections of law, such as the education statute, the child welfare statute, and custody laws.</p>



<p>The measure also includes in statute the call for strict judicial scrutiny that has thus far only been a matter of court precedent. Section 1014.03 of the Florida code will hereafter declare:</p>



<p>&amp;nbsp;<strong>The state…may not infringe on the fundamental rights of a parent to direct the upbringing, education, health care, and mental health of his or her minor child without demonstrating that such action is reasonable and necessary to achieve a <em>compelling state interest</em> and that such action is <em>narrowly tailored</em> and is not otherwise served by a <em>less restrictive means</em> (emphasis added).</strong>
</p>



<p>These key phrases—“compelling interest,” “narrowly tailored,” and “least restrictive means”—are the backbone of the “strict scrutiny” standard of review. Adding this requirement into the legal code won’t change the current practice, but it will prevent erosion of parental rights by a shifting judiciary in the future.</p>



<p>Now parents, children, school boards, and family defense attorneys will all have one section of Florida law they can turn to when questions arise about the proper role of parents or the government when it comes to raising children.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>“It happened! It happened! It happened!”</strong>
</h2>



<p>For ParentalRights.org Florida State Coordinator Patti Sullivan and her family, this is a tremendous personal victory. <strong>They have been working toward this law literally for years.</strong>
</p>



<p>“All the hard work and effort of so many years have come to fruition with the passing of this law,” she told me for this article. <strong>“Now we’re looking forward to parents stepping up into their rights in the days ahead.”</strong>
</p>



<p>“This law creates an environment for [parents] to engage in their children’s lives and know what is going on.”</p>



<p>This reflects a concern Rep. Erin Grall, who sponsored the bill in the House, also addressed in her closing comments from April 1.</p>



<p>
<strong>“Parents have been put on the sidelines for too long,”</strong> Grall declared on the House floor. “Children are in crisis, and those who love them most are not even being given information about the crisis.”</p>



<p>That is one thing the Parents’ Bill of Rights will change. School boards will have a harder time with their recent efforts to keep a child’s information secret from parents. Instead, the passage of this legislation will protect vulnerable children by keeping their parents in the loop.</p>



<p>Patti told me, <strong>“Now the law affirms what parents already knew: that their parental rights are fundamental.”</strong>
</p>



<p>Then, in a burst of excitement, she cheered, “It happened! It happened! It happened!”</p>



<p>“We have a law now, and it specifically says parental rights are ‘fundamental.’”</p>



<p>We are so grateful to Patti for her tireless efforts, to Rep. Grall for leading the way in the Florida House, and to the senators who championed it in the Senate, Sen. Stargell (in 2019) and Sen. Rodrigues (this year).</p>



<p>And <strong>I am thankful to you for standing with us </strong>as we celebrate this victory in Florida, and we look forward to similar tidings soon from other states, as well.</p>



<p>
<strong>Together we are changing the landscape, empowering parents, and keeping our children safe.</strong>
</p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>

<![CDATA[<p>The proposed Parents’ Bill of Rights in Florida has taken great strides in the past week, and it is well on its way to being adopted into law.</p>



<p>First, <a href="https://www.myfloridahouse.gov/Sections/Bills/billsdetail.aspx?BillId=70313">House Bill 241</a> passed the Florida House by a vote of 78–37 on Thursday, April 1.</p>



<p>Then, <a href="https://www.myfloridahouse.gov/Sections/Bills/billsdetail.aspx?BillId=70279">Senate Bill 582</a> was taken up in the Senate Rules Committee yesterday, April 6, and “reported favorably.” (The vote count is not yet available, as the result to “report favorably” was clear on the live stream but individual votes were not.)</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>Crossing the Finish Line in the Florida House</strong>
</h2>



<p>In most states, a bill has to go through a House committee and receive a favorable report from that committee before it can go to the floor of the House for a vote. <strong>In Florida, a bill does not go through a committee first—it goes through <em>three</em>!</strong>
</p>



<p>Sponsored by Rep. Erin Grall, H.B. 241 passed the House Health and Human Services Committee on March 2 by a vote of 13–7. Then it passed the House Judiciary Committee on the 17th by a vote of 14–7, and finally the Education &amp; Employment Committee on March 24 by a vote of 15–6.</p>



<p>So, on April 1, it came up for “Third Reading,” meaning a final vote by the entire House. A few organizations spoke in opposition to the bill, followed by three state lawmakers who spoke in favor. Finally, Rep. Grall gave her closing comments.</p>



<p>
<strong>“We have taken the focus off family for too long, to the detriment of society,”</strong> Grall declared. “We hear… the horror stories of the bad parent, the abusive parent, the intolerant parent. And I continue to refuse to accept that we should diminish the rights of all parents in the raising of their children because of the acts of a few.”</p>



<p>Rep. Grall also called out the organizations who opposed this legislation to protect the parental role. “Based upon the opposition to this bill,” she stated, “<strong>it is clear that liberties have been taken for too long with regard to accessing our children. </strong>The fact that any entity is concerned that their ‘right’ to access our children is being infringed upon makes the case for this legislation.”</p>



<p>“She hit it out of the park,” ParentalRights.org State Coordinator Patti Sullivan told me later.</p>



<p>The House apparently agreed. They passed the bill by a vote of 78–37.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>The Final Hurdle in the Senate</strong>
</h2>



<p>Despite the good news in the House, however, <strong>the Senate was always going to be the bigger challenge for the Florida bill this year.</strong> Last year’s bill passed the House, just as H.B. 241 did this year, but its Senate companion failed to get a vote in the Senate Rules Committee.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>
<strong>“I was amazed at the pushback I received in running a bill that I thought, to me, was just common sense and obvious,”</strong> last year’s sponsor, Senator Kelli Stargell, testified in yesterday’s hearing.</p>



<p>Last year, that committee was discussing the bill on the final day when the deadline passed, bringing a frustrating end to what had looked like a promising run.</p>



<p>That’s a fate this year’s S.B. 582 would not suffer, though, as the Rules Committee took it up yesterday, April 6—with weeks left in the legislative session—and <strong>voted to recommend its passage.</strong>
</p>



<p>A few senators opposed the bill, expressing concern that it would keep minors from getting health care or counseling without parental consent. But the bill as written still allows all the same carve-outs currently present in Florida law, including allowing adolescents to seek confidential care in areas of reproduction, drug or alcohol use, and mental health.</p>



<p>
<strong>This favorable committee vote opens the door for the bill to go to the floor of the Senate, putting it closer to passage than it has ever been.</strong>
</p>



<p>With several weeks still to go in Florida’s legislative session, we are cautiously optimistic that we will see the Parents’ Bill of Rights become law there this year.</p>



<p>I must express appreciation to our Florida state coordinators, Jim and Patti Sullivan, who have tirelessly worked with their lawmakers to bring the bill to this point. They have done a tremendous job bringing attention to the need for parental rights and answering questions about the bill that will preserve those rights in law.</p>



<p>And I thank you for standing with us as we promote bills like the Florida Parents’ Bill of Rights to protect our families from unnecessary government intrusion.</p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Legislative sessions around the country are in full swing, and several parental rights bills are still in play.</p>



<p>
<strong>In Iowa, a bill to codify existing state Supreme Court precedent has passed the House and is heading to committee hearings in the Senate this week.</strong> In fact, by the time this newsletter reaches you, <a href="https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation/BillBook?ba=HF819&amp;ga=89" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">House File 819 </a>will have been through a subcommittee and will be in the committee, or even on its way to the Senate floor.</p>



<p>There is still some language in that bill to be worked out between the House and Senate versions, but that discussion is expected to take place over the next couple of weeks.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>Indiana’s “Exigent Circumstances”</strong>
</h2>



<p>In Indiana, a dangerous bill that attempted to redefine “exigent circumstances” into pretty much whatever the Department of Child Services (DCS) wants it to be has been amended to conform more to actual constitutional law. <strong>Under this bill “Exigent circumstances” could allow DCS to enter your home or, in this case, interview your child, without consent or a warrant. </strong>But, for more than 70 years, the courts have limited the term to those times when officials <em>must act </em>to protect someone from harm or halt a crime in progress, and <em>there is no time to get a warrant.</em>
</p>



<p>In its original form, <a href="http://iga.in.gov/legislative/2021/bills/house/1531#document-02d157cc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">House Bill 1531</a> would have redefined “exigent circumstances” to include any time the parent was alleged to have abused their child. The accusation alone could be enough! </p>



<p>Nationally we know that more than 80 percent of all child abuse investigations are closed as unfounded or unsubstantiated. Can you imagine if DCS could claim exigent circumstances in all of those cases? <strong>Can you imagine how many innocent families would be violated by such a law?</strong>
</p>



<p>In most cases, DCS has time to get a warrant if there is evidence to support it. Only if a child is in imminent danger do exigent circumstances exist.</p>



<p>In its original form, the bill would take the erroneous language of the state DCS manual and make it law. As amended in the Senate, this bill will be a step towards providing correction to the manual, instead.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>Florida and Kentucky</strong>
</h2>



<p>In Florida, the Parents’ Bill of Rights (<a href="https://www.myfloridahouse.gov/Sections/Bills/billsdetail.aspx?BillId=70279, https://www.myfloridahouse.gov/Sections/Bills/billsdetail.aspx?BillId=70313" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">House Bill 241/Senate Bill 582</a>) has made it through all three House committees and two committees in the Senate. Where most states send a bill to one committee in each house, Florida has three in each, <strong>and still we are only one committee—the Senate Rules Committee—away from both floor votes.</strong>
</p>



<p>This bill gathers existing Florida law, which is currently scattered throughout the code, into one specific place where families, their lawyers, and state entities can easily go to see the rights protected there.</p>



<p>And finally, <a href="https://apps.legislature.ky.gov/record/21RS/hb221.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">House Bill 221</a> in Kentucky, <strong>a bill to replace anonymous reporting with confidential reporting, passed the House by a vote of 96–0 on March 1</strong>, and was reported favorably from the Senate Health and Welfare Committee on March 11. A floor amendment passed this week likely means it will need to go back to the House once it passes the Senate, but so far its progress is promising.</p>



<p>
<strong>There are other bills, as well, and we will keep you posted by email alert if it turns out action is needed in your state.</strong>
</p>



<p>Thank you for standing with us to support good legislation to protect children by protecting your parental rights.</p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>

<![CDATA[<p>
<strong>Your state representative needs to hear from you in </strong>
<strong>the next few hours</strong> so they can vote to support your parental rights.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Iowa <a href="https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation/BillBook?ba=HF819&amp;ga=89">H.F. 819</a>, a bill to codify existing parental rights protections into Iowa law, is on the debate schedule for today, March 25, 2021.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Sponsored by Rep. Eddie Anders, H.F. 819 takes language from existing Iowa Supreme Court cases regarding the fundamental nature of parental rights and places that language in the Iowa legal code. <strong>This bill does not <em>change</em> what your parental rights are, but <em>preserves them</em> against the shifting ideologies of the judiciary.</strong>
</p>



<p>And that’s just what your lawmaker needs to hear.</p>



<p>Those pushing back against this bill are warning about vague, undefined, “unintended consequences.” <strong>But there can be no unintended consequences from this bill, as it merely reflects the legal reality that already exists in Iowa regarding parental rights.</strong>
</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>Take Action</strong>
</h2>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>If you don’t yet know who your state representative is, you can find out by putting your address in the search bar on <a href="https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislators/find">this page</a>.</li>
<li>Once you know who your representative is, you can find their email address on <a href="https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislators/house">the list here</a>.</li>
<li>Here’s what they need to hear from you, in your own words:</li>
</ol>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>My name is ______ and I live in your district. I am writing to urge your support for the original language of H.F. 819 to preserve the fundamental liberty of parents to direct the education, care, custody, and control of their minor children. This bill won’t make any changes to the law, but will codify in statute what is already the law as applied by our courts.&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>The bill contains language from our own courts protecting the vital parent role. I want to see that language put into statute so a different judge down the road can’t take those rights away from subsequent generations.</p>
<p>Please vote ‘yes’ on the original language of H.F. 819 when it comes up today.</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Move It Forward</h2>



<p>Senator Brad Zaun is standing ready to take up leadership of this bill as soon as it makes it to the Senate. But we have to get it to him, and that means it needs to pass the House. <strong>So please take a moment right now, before you close this email, to contact your Iowa state representative and urge them to protect your family by voting “yes” on H.F. 819.</strong>
</p>



<p>Thank you for standing with us in this vital hour to protect children and families by preserving parental rights in the Hawkeye State.</p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>



<p>Barb Heki, Iowa State Coordinator, &amp;<br>Michael Ramey, Executive Director</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Our nation is at a crossroads, and countless American families hang in the balance.</p>



<p>First, we are at a crossroads between administrations, as Joe Biden replaces Donald Trump in the White House and in setting policy and direction for our federal government.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Whatever one thinks of either man or his party, there is no question they are different—and this change of administration will bring significant change for family policies.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>While many have strong feelings either for or against the outgoing president, we have seen real strides in keeping families together as a matter of law and policy, thanks to the direction set by a Trump appointee in the Children’s Bureau of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS).&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>And in the Family First Prevention Services Act, <strong>we have seen a groundbreaking new law passed to keep families together.</strong>
</p>



<p>Now as we shift to the Biden Administration, we are left to wonder if the new president will keep these developments or bring “change,” which in this case would mean reverting to the system of splitting families without good cause.</p>



<p>While that potential change is a big deal on its own, ParentalRights.org is facing our own crossroads as we prepare to close the books on one fiscal year and launch our efforts in a new one.</p>



<p>
<strong>How we finish this fiscal year will shape what we can do in the next.</strong>
</p>



<p>At this juncture—both historical and fiscal—I am prompted to look back not just on the nation but on our organization, to consider what we have accomplished together in the last year. And I am prompted to ask myself how we will address the challenges that lie before us for the year ahead.</p>



<p>
<strong>Thanks to the generous and passionate support of our giving partners, this past year has been one of victories.</strong>
</p>



<p>Legislatively, though the 2020 session was fraught with challenges to parental rights, we escaped relatively unscathed due to many supporters voicing their opposition to dangerous bills. In Virginia, for instance, a bill that would have limited a child’s counseling choices based solely on content—a threat to both parental rights and the First Amendment—was tabled for the year.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>And an “education amendment” in Minnesota, which would have added to the state’s constitution that “every child has a fundamental right to a quality public education,” was likewise put on hold. Enough parents raised their voices against this dangerous notion (which might have unintentionally removed any other educational option from parents) that the bill could not go further.</p>



<p>
<strong>Now, the scary thing about both of these examples is that they have come back this year.</strong> That was not unexpected, but it means we have to remain vigilant. We have to keep up the pressure, because the sponsors of these measures have not given up.</p>



<p>No sooner had we defeated these bills last year, than COVID-19 struck in earnest and the whole landscape changed. Suddenly, “what are my rights if my child is bullied at school?” was no longer a big question for us.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead, it was, “what are my rights if I don’t trust this experimental new vaccine?”&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Or “what are my alternatives if I don’t like how my child’s school is handling online learning?”</p>



<p>This last question was huge, as more and more parents opted out of the online schooling provided by their district and took up other options instead. The number of families homeschooling approximately doubled. Private school enrollment took off, too.</p>



<p>Of course, <strong>some parental rights concerns not only didn’t improve but actually <em>intensified</em>—like the tendency of child welfare departments to separate families</strong>, or to use COVID as an excuse to keep families who were already separated from receiving the visitation or the court hearings they were due.</p>



<p>
<strong>In a time when businesses and activities were being labeled “essential” or “non-essential,” <em>families were being tossed in the wrong pile.&amp;nbsp;</em>
</strong>
</p>



<p>Families were in danger again.</p>



<p>Fortunately, thanks to your partnership, we were in place to take a stand.</p>



<p>We immediately set out with a bipartisan group of allies to call Congress’s attention to this error and urge the federal government to fix it. And while Congress has been slow to act, the Children’s Bureau of the DHHS was listening and actually lent its voice to the call to halt family separations and recognize family as “essential.”</p>



<p>Now, I’m not trying to tell you we put words in their mouth. At best, we lent them a little bipartisan cover so they could take a bold stand for families. Most likely, we just happened to be on the same page at the same time.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>But that was enough to start a real conversation about reforming federal law to protect families, and <strong>that’s a conversation that is still ongoing as we enter this new Congress.</strong>
</p>



<p>While all of that was going on, the Parental Rights Foundation—our 501(c)(3) policy and education arm—was enjoying a string of victories, getting innocent names off child abuse registries, siding with a fit father before the Texas Supreme Court, and getting bipartisan support for legislative policies both to provide due process <em>before</em> a name goes on a registry and to do away with anonymous reports to child abuse hotlines.</p>



<p>Like our political efforts to halt bad legislation and to halt the clock that is separating families who just need more time, though, these policy efforts are also still ongoing.</p>



<p>Most recently, we have been engaged with Congress to halt the <a href="https://parentalrights.org/urgent-call-congress-to-oppose-minor-consent-bill/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dangerous Minor Consent to Vaccination Act in Washington, DC.</a>
</p>



<p>This dangerous and ill-advised law would allow a child as young as 11 years old—an elementary school student!—to provide legally binding consent for a vaccination the parent has already opted out of.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Even worse, <strong>it contains provisions to make sure the parent <em>never finds out</em> about it</strong>.</p>



<p>Imagine if you could never be sure you know the full medical history of your 11-year-old.</p>



<p>Worse yet, one unintended consequence of these provisions is that if your family doctor is not the one who gave your child the shot, <strong>your doctor won’t know your child’s medical history, either.</strong>
</p>



<p>Serious harm can come from giving a child too many doses of some vaccines, but neither you nor your doctor would know you were making that tragic mistake.</p>



<p>This bill is dangerous to every child in the district, but it is also dangerous to <em>your</em> child—because <strong>if this law stands in DC, its proponents will be bringing it to your state next.</strong>
</p>



<p>We’re standing guard against that threat, along with the other legislative dangers I mentioned.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Yet, through all of this, your support has sustained us and kept us in the fight.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>In fact, fiscal year 2021 has been our strongest year in recent memory, and that is thanks to our partners. That is thanks to you.</p>



<p>
<strong>We remain a tiny organization with a large voice for families, but this tiny organization may be starting to grow.</strong>
</p>



<p>And all of this is why I’m writing to you today.</p>



<p>You see, we have to continue our efforts into fiscal year 2022, because none of these vital projects are finished.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>
<strong>State lawmakers are still coming after parental rights</strong> in mental health, vaccine decisions, educational choice, and a myriad of other areas of law.</p>



<p>Innocent parents are still being wrongfully included on state child abuse registries.</p>



<p>Healing families are still being kept apart, or even separated permanently, because of onerous restrictions and obstacles brought on by the government’s response to COVID.</p>



<p>
<strong>And <a href="https://parentalrights.org/urgent-call-congress-to-oppose-minor-consent-bill/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that DC vaccine consent bill </a>is still sitting before Congress, on its way to becoming law if we can’t get our lawmakers to act.</strong>
</p>



<p>So we need to finish this fiscal year well and launch the next with our best month possible. We need to stay financially healthy so we can stand strong in the face of these threats to our families.</p>



<p>With a new American president, things are going to change. We don’t yet know how, but change is inevitable.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>
<strong>And to be ready to meet that change, whatever it is, we need to be in the strongest position possible.</strong>
</p>



<p>You have made this year a success both fiscally and legislatively, which is where it matters most. But our job is not yet done.</p>



<p>Can I count on you to <a href="http://parentalrights.org/donate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">help us finish strong</a> as we take up the challenges of the year ahead?</p>



<p>
<strong>Together, you and I can win these victories and secure lasting change for America’s families.</strong>
</p>



<p>Will you join us in launching fiscal year 2022 on the best possible ground for victory?</p>



<p>Thank you for partnering with us this year and always. Thank you for standing with us to protect children by empowering parents, together.</p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>

<![CDATA[<p>We are in a critical moment for Parental Rights in Florida. <strong>We need you as Florida parents to contact your state district Representative, Senator, and Senate Leadership.</strong>&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>In the current Florida legislative session, the Parents’ Bill of Rights is gaining traction among those Florida legislators who understand that putting Florida families first is a legislative priority. Others, however, won’t understand the priority that it <em>must</em> be <strong>unless they hear from their constituents.</strong>
</p>



<p>The Bill was introduced by Representative Erin Grall as <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2021/241" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">H.B. 241</a> and Senator Ray Rodriguez as <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2021/582" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">S.B. 582.</a> This bill creates the “Parents’ Bill of Rights” <strong>prohibiting the state, its political subdivisions, other governmental entities, or other institutions from infringing on parental rights</strong> unless specified conditions are met; requiring each district school board to develop and adopt a policy to promote parental involvement in the public school system; prohibiting health care practitioners and their employees from providing health care services or prescribing medicinal drugs to a minor child without a parent’s written consent, etc.</p>



<p>(It does not change existing law, however, regarding those areas of medical practice where minors are already legally authorized to consent to their own care.)</p>



<p>
<strong>Please contact your Representative and Senator and ask them to support and co-sponsor this bill.&amp;nbsp; We only have a <em>few more weeks</em> to get the bill through two more committees in the House and two more in the Senate, as well.</strong>
</p>



<p>Find and contact <a href="https://www.myfloridahouse.gov/FindYourRepresentative" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">your Representative here.&amp;nbsp;</a>
</p>



<p>Find and contact <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2021/582" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">your Senator here</a>.</p>



<p>Senate Leadership especially need to hear from their own District constituents asking them to fully support this bill. Please let them know that you are in their District.</p>



<p>If you are in Senate District 10:</p>



<p>
<a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Offices/President" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Contact Senate President Wilton Simpson here</a>.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Senator Mike Lee of Utah, author of a resolution in the Senate (S.J. Res. 7) to veto a dangerous DC law that would give 11-year-olds responsibility for their own vaccine decisions, called for the veto measure to be passed by common consent on Tuesday afternoon.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>Senator Lee: Ought to Be Parents’ Decision</strong>
</h2>



<p>“Madam President,” Senator Lee began, “the Minor Consent for Vaccination Amendment Act of 2020 is a measure adopted by the District of Columbia that would allow children 11 years old and older to consent on their own, without their parents’ knowledge or acquiescence or consent, to being vaccinated.”</p>



<p>Sen. Lee continued, “<strong>Now, young children don’t even necessarily know their own medical history, their own family’s medical history, or potential allergies. Nor do they have the adult judgment that’s sometimes needed to make an informed decision</strong> as to consent for a particular medical procedure or treatment, or even vaccination.” </p>



<p>Lee’s arguments for halting the DC law included the fundamental right of parents to make decisions for their children, concern for children’s health, respect for opposing views on vaccines, differing physical reactions to vaccines in one’s family history, and a concern that the bill “would pave the way for allowing children to consent to other types of treatment without parental knowledge down the road.”</p>



<p>In summing up, he declared, <strong>“These ought to be decisions that are made by parents, and certainly ought not be considered and made by children as young as 11 years old and without their parents’ consent or even their knowledge.”</strong> We soundly agree.</p>



<p>Had the common consent procedure passed, the resolution would have been pulled from the Senate Committee of Homeland Security and Government Affairs without a vote, immediately brought to the floor for “third reading,” and considered passed. In just a few short minutes, S.J. Res. 7 would have gone from “stuck in committee” to “passed the Senate.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>Objection Raised</strong>
</h2>



<p>But the “common consent” mechanism requires that there be <em>no objection whatsoever</em>.</p>



<p>In this case, Senator Tom Carper (D-DE) objected to Lee’s proposal, citing his position that the Senate should not second-guess the decisions of the DC Council. (Senator Lee later rebutted that overseeing decisions for DC is a constitutional responsibility of the Congress, as provided in Article 1 of the Constitution.)</p>



<p>Because of Carper’s dissent, S.J. Res. 7 was not passed by common consent. As a result, <strong>it remains in the Homeland Security Committee to await its normal course of action.</strong>
</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>Time Is Running Out</strong>
</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, time is running out. If the resolution is not passed and signed by the president by March 18, the DC law will go into effect.</p>



<p>So, while children’s health and—in some extreme cases—lives hang in the balance, some in Congress are playing politics, using the measure to push for DC statehood: a political hot potato that has nothing to do with our children’s welfare.</p>



<p>Of Carper’s objections to passing the resolution, he raised&amp;nbsp;<em>none whatsoever</em>&amp;nbsp;that had to do with the concerning&amp;nbsp;<em>content</em>&amp;nbsp;of the DC law being opposed, perhaps because <strong>even those who want the law to stand know better than to tell a nation full of parents that they simply don’t trust you to make the right decisions for your child.</strong>
</p>



<p>With this new development, and with appreciation to Senator Lee for so championing the effort to halt this law, <strong>it is as important as ever to make sure your lawmakers know your support for the veto resolutions, H.J. Res. 25 in the House and S.J. Res. 7 in the Senate.</strong>
</p>



<p>At this point, Senator Lee is joined by 6 cosponsors on<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-joint-resolution/7?s=1&amp;r=41" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> S.J.Res.7</a>, while <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-joint-resolution/25" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">H.J.Res.25</a> has 16 total sponsors in the House. But much more support is needed.</p>



<p>This bill is bad for children and we must work together to stop it.</p>



<p>You can weigh in through the VoterVoice system of our friends at Home School Legal Defense Association by <a href="https://hslda.org/legal/legislation?vvsrc=/campaigns/77926/respond">clicking here</a>.</p>



<p>Thank you for standing with us now, as always, to defend the vital role of parents in representing their children and guarding their welfare.</p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>

<![CDATA[<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>Update on DC Minor Consent Act</strong>
</h2>



<p>If you aren’t yet familiar with the bill in DC that would allow 11-year-olds to give legal consent for vaccinations their parents have already opted them out of, you can read up on it <a href="https://parentalrights.org/dc-council-would-discard-constitution-end-parents-rights/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here.</a>
</p>



<p>If you haven’t yet reached out to your US representative and senators and urged them to support the resolution in Congress to veto this dangerous DC act and keep it from coming to <em>your</em> state, you can do so through the VoterVoice system provided by our allies at Home School Legal Defense Association<a href="https://hslda.org/legal/legislation?vvsrc=/campaigns/77926/respond" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> here.</a>
</p>



<p>And if you <em>have</em> reached out, but that was a week ago (or more), you can <em>reach out again</em> through the same tool <a href="https://hslda.org/legal/legislation?vvsrc=/campaigns/77926/respond" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>



<p>So far, our efforts have reached all 535 voting members of Congress. The resolution has gained nine cosponsors in the House and five in the Senate. But much more needs to be done, especially in securing support among Democrats.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>Good Legislation</strong>
</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>Iowa’s Parental Rights Bill</strong>
</h3>



<p>Representative Eddie Andrews in Iowa is introducing <strong>a bill to codify in statute the high standard of parental rights currently recognized by Iowa’s courts.</strong> The bill will not change the law for or against parents; it will not add to or remove any existing rights.</p>



<p>But by codifying the standard that the courts currently employ into the statutory law, this bill will protect those rights from changes in the judiciary. As it is now, since parental rights in Iowa are only protected by the courts, they can be changed on a whim when a governor appoints judges who think differently than the current standard.</p>



<p>Although the deadline to introduce legislation has passed, Rep. Andrews already has a prefiled placeholder bill specifically for parental rights legislation. This parental rights bill will fill that spot, and we will have a bill number once it does.</p>



<p>Senator Brad Zaun, who chairs the state senate’s judiciary committee, is also fully supportive of this bill. So when it passes the House and goes to the Senate, he will be ready to take it from there and see it to final victory.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>Montana’s Confidential Reporting Bill</strong>
</h3>



<p>Another good bill is <a href="http://laws.leg.mt.gov/legprd/LAW0203W$BSRV.ActionQuery?P_SESS=20211&amp;P_BLTP_BILL_TYP_CD=HB&amp;P_BILL_NO=356&amp;P_BILL_DFT_NO=&amp;P_CHPT_NO=&amp;Z_ACTION=Find&amp;P_ENTY_ID_SEQ2=&amp;P_SBJT_SBJ_CD=&amp;P_ENTY_ID_SEQ=">HB 356</a> in Montana, which would <strong>do away with anonymous reporting to child abuse hotlines. </strong>Under this bill, anyone calling in would have to give their name and address, but their information would still be kept confidential.</p>



<p>This means that people with a legitimate concern about their safety will still be protected: no one except the hotline and the department will know they called. But getting rid of purely anonymous reporting will cut down on the number of false and malicious reports, such as those calling in a false report to get a leg up in a custody dispute.</p>



<p>The bill, introduced by Rep. Lenz, was heard in the Human Services Committee on February 17.</p>



<p>Sadly, it faces opposition by the Child and Family Services Division of the state health department, <em>the very people who should support this measure</em>. <strong>It is likely to reduce their workload and free them up to find those children who really are in need of services and protection from abuse.</strong>
</p>



<p>Those who spoke in favor of the bill? Not surprisingly, it was a group of parents. They argued, rightly, that the bill will cut down on false or retaliatory filings with the hotline.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>Bad Legislation</strong>
</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>Indiana’s H.B. 1531</strong>
</h3>



<p>In Indiana, meanwhile, a well-intentioned lawmaker has introduced a bill that poses a danger for children and for your parental rights. Rep. DeVon has amended his bill a couple of times already to try to get it right, but the version that passed the House on third reading on Monday is still problematic at best.</p>



<p>The bill, <a href="http://iga.in.gov/legislative/2021/bills/house/1531#document-0e451b6b">H.B. 1531</a>, seeks to provide clarity for schools regarding how they are to respond if a child services worker comes to the school to interview a child for the sake of an abuse investigation.</p>



<p>
<strong>Unfortunately, the bill would allow the department of child services to be the arbiter of whether or not it is necessary for the department to interview a child without the parent’s consent.</strong>
</p>



<p>Now, there are times when it is perfectly reasonable to allow such an investigation. If the parent is the alleged abuser, and there is evidence that the child would be in danger if he had to return home or if the parent learned of the investigation, then it would make sense for the school to let the investigation take place on school grounds without the parent’s knowledge.</p>



<p>But this is already available under Indiana law. <strong>As in most states, the investigator could take that information to a judge and get a warrant permitting them to talk to the child without the parent’s consent.</strong>
</p>



<p>This bill would cut out the judge and allow the investigator to decide for himself or herself whether it is necessary. That is the equivalent of leaving the fox to guard the proverbial hen house.</p>



<p>It is also a violation of the Fourth Amendment’s protection of due process, which is where the requirement for a warrant comes from.</p>



<p>We are working with volunteers to find a lawmaker who can help us stop this bill in the Senate, or at least remove the troubling provision.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>Taking Action</strong>
</h2>



<p>This is not all of the legislation we are watching regarding parental rights this session, but these are the hot spots this week. Sometimes a call blitz or email storm in support of or against a particular bill may be necessary to protect your rights, but we are also often able to resolve these issues through direct contact with lawmakers.</p>



<p>
<strong>Should a bill demand action in your state, </strong>we will let you know with an email alert to that effect.</p>



<p>
<strong>And you can help!</strong> If you see concerning legislation in your state, please let me know about it at <a href="mailto:Michael@parentalrights.org">Michael@parentalrights.org</a>.</p>



<p>Finally, consider donating today to support the fight to protect families like yours and mine.</p>



<p>Thank you as always for standing with us to protect children and families by empowering parents through good state legislation.</p>

<strong>The DC “Minor Consent for Vaccinations Act of 2020” is now in Congress, where we have only a few weeks to pass a crucial veto resolution before it becomes law in the district and a model for other states to follow.</strong>
</p>



<p>You should have received a special email yesterday alerting you to <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-joint-resolution/7/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22SJRes.+7%22%5D%7D&amp;r=1&amp;s=4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">S.J.Res.7 </a>in the Senate and <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-joint-resolution/25/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22HJRes.+25%22%5D%7D&amp;r=1&amp;s=3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">H.J.Res.25</a> in the United States House, both containing the resolution to veto the Minor Consent Act. In case you missed it, you can read that <a href="https://parentalrights.org/urgent-call-congress-to-oppose-minor-consent-bill/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>



<p>Here’s what you need to know:&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>DC bill 23-171, the “Minor Consent for Vaccinations Act of 2020,” would not only allow children <strong>as young as 11 years old</strong> <strong>to give legally binding consent to receive a vaccine</strong>, it would also <strong>prohibit the provider from recording the shot in the child’s medical record</strong>; require the provider to send the record only to the child’s school; <strong>prohibit the school from recording the vaccination</strong> in any record the parents might see; and <strong>even prohibit the insurance carrier from sending an explanation of benefits</strong> listing the vaccination.</p>



<p>The purpose of these provisions is clear: they’re meant not just to cut parents out of their child’s medical decisions, but also <strong>to keep the parents from ever knowing the vaccination took place.</strong> And if the family physician is not the one administering the shot? Well, there’s no way for them to find out about it, either.</p>



<p>What’s even worse, once this bill has passed in DC, it will become an example for other states to follow. <strong>Soon it will be in my state and yours, and <em>our</em> children will be the ones in danger.</strong>
</p>



<p>
<strong>So right now we are urging everyone to contact your members of Congress</strong>—both the House and the Senate—and urge them to support H.J.Res.25 (in the House) or S.J.Res.7 (in the Senate) to veto this dangerous DC law. You can contact them directly and easily using the VoterVoice system of our allies at Home School Legal Defense Association <a href="https://hslda.org/legal/legislation?vvsrc=/campaigns/77926/respond" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here.</a>
</p>



<p>
<strong>If your congressman or senator is a Democrat, they especially need to hear from you.</strong> Since both resolutions are championed by Republicans, Democrats may be slow to sign on. And since DC’s own congressional representative, Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, has recently spoken out in favor of DC’s overreaching act, it will be even tougher for Democrats in Congress to take a stand for parents against this bill.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>They will need your encouragement to do the right thing—to respect families and protect children.</p>



<p>What’s more, if they are a Democrat, don’t just ask them to vote “yes” on their resolution. <strong>Urge them to consider signing on as a cosponsor.</strong> Their name on the resolution will reflect the bipartisan nature of support for parents and families that we see in our society at large.</p>



<p>So please take a moment today to reach out to your lawmakers and urge them to take a stand for children by supporting the veto resolutions in Congress.</p>



<p>
<strong>If this dangerous legislation is allowed to stand in DC, it will soon rear its head in your state, as well.</strong> We must stop it now, before it spreads and places more children’s lives in danger.</p>



<p>Thank you for standing with us to protect children by empowering parents.</p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Please contact your congressmember and senators <em>today</em> and urge them to <em>support</em> SJRes. 7 and HJRes. 25, the joint resolution to veto DC Bill 23-171. <a href="https://www.votervoice.net/HSLDA/campaigns/77926/respond" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Click here to reach out to your lawmakers through Voter Voice.</a>
</p>



<p>DC 23-171, the “Minor Consent for Vaccinations Act of 2020,” would allow 11-year-olds to give consent for vaccinations their parents have already declined. It also requires the vaccine provider and the child’s school to<strong> hide the child’s vaccination status from the child’s parent(s), </strong>
<em>even to the point that an insurer cannot send an Explanation of Benefits (EOB) listing the vaccination.</em>
</p>



<p>The bill was adopted in the district on December 23 when Mayor Muriel Bowser declined to veto it during her 10-day window to do so. It will take effect on &amp;nbsp;March 23 unless Congress passes a veto resolution in the next 30 legislative days.</p>



<p>Congressman Michael Cloud introduced HJRes 25 in the House on Thursday to veto the measure. Senator Mike Lee introduced matching resolution SJRes. 7 in the Senate.</p>



<p>
<strong>Congress has only 30 legislative days to pass the resolution to keep the Minor Consent Bill from becoming permanent law in the capital, which would set a precedent many states could try to follow.</strong>
</p>



<p>(Note: It can be a little confusing, but because the resolution is to veto the bill, we <em>oppose</em> the bill by <em>supporting</em> the resolution.)</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>Background</strong>
</h2>



<p>DC Bill 23-171 allows minors to consent to vaccination without their parent’s knowledge or consent and would keep any knowledge of the vaccination from the child’s parents even long after the fact.</p>



<p>What this bill does:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Permits <strong>children as young as 11 years old</strong> to give legal consent for vaccination if the vaccine is government approved and the parents have opted out of it for their child.</li>
<li>
<strong>Prohibits the administering medical provider from documenting the vaccine</strong> in the vaccination section of the child’s normal medical record.</li>
<li>Requires the administering provider to submit the vaccination record directly to the child’s school.</li>
<li>Prohibits the school from including this vaccination record with the rest of the child’s educational record.</li>
<li>
<strong>Prohibits the school from providing this information to the child’s parent</strong>.</li>
<li>
<strong>Prohibits any insurance provider from sending an Explanation of Benefits (or EOB) indicating the vaccination</strong>.</li>
</ul>



<p>Children are best protected from harm when their parents, who know and love them best, are empowered to make informed decisions about their care. This scheme, on the other hand, is designed to keep the child’s parents <em>permanently in the dark</em> about the vaccine and would even keep the child’s family physician as much in the dark as the parents are.</p>



<p>How can parents take proper care of their child in that situation?</p>

<![CDATA[<p>The US House Committee on Education and Labor recently announced the introduction of the Stronger Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, or “Stronger CAPTA,” to amend the primary federal statutes dealing with how child welfare agencies across the country operate.</p>



<p>Bobby Scott (D-VA) is the lead sponsor on the bill, joined by a bipartisan collection of his committee colleagues—Reps. Suzanne Bonamici (OR), Kim Schrier (WA), and Haley Stevens (MI) from the Democrat side and Reps. James Comer (KY), Dusty Johnson (SD), Elise Stefanik (NY) and Virginia Foxx (NC) from the Republicans.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>As the 109-page bill was just released late Monday (January 25), we have not yet had a chance to review everything in it and we have not reached a final conclusion on whether it is good or bad. Ultimately, as one would expect, it has some elements of both.</p>



<p>
<strong>Our aim as an organization will be to support the good and urge the committee to rework the bad </strong>into something that respects families while protecting children at risk of abuse.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>The Good</strong>
</h2>



<p>On the good side, this bill acknowledges some of the biggest problems we have observed in the child protection system, and calls for them to be studied and corrected. Here are five examples:</p>



<p>First, it calls for the <strong>gathering and reporting of data on how often anonymous, erroneous, and sometimes knowingly false reports take resources away</strong> from the efforts to find and protect abused children.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>
<strong>It also recognizes and looks to relieve racial bias in the system.</strong>
</p>



<p>And it builds on recent advances to fund preventive programs—those aimed at keeping families together rather than breaking them apart—so that fewer children end up in foster care.</p>



<p>
<strong>We are especially excited to see the bill call for better definitions of “neglect,”</strong> so that fewer children will be removed from families simply because of poverty. We call this principle “poverty is not neglect,” and as simple and obvious as that sounds, it will be a new and exciting concept in federal law and in many of the states.</p>



<p>And, finally,&amp;nbsp; Section 106 of the proposal would <strong>change the removal standard to “imminent harm,”</strong> meaning a child should not be removed from their home unless there is an immediate risk to their physical health.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>The Bad</strong>
</h2>



<p>Not everything in the bill has us excited, however.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Our biggest concern is the call for <strong>“an electronic system that allows states to share data from their child abuse and neglect registries with other states.” </strong>(Source: <a href="https://edlabor.house.gov/imo/media/doc/2021-01-25%2520Stronger%2520CAPTA%2520Fact%2520Sheet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">House Committee on Education &amp; Labor Fact Sheet</a>)</p>



<p>If there were proper protections in place to safeguard innocent families by granting due process before a name goes on the registry, this would not be such a problem. But as it stands, a large majority of the names on state registries do not belong there. Roughly 80% of those listed on a registry, if they appeal, will see their names removed.</p>



<p>By providing a system to link these registries, <strong>this bill will take the damage caused by an improper listing and spread it nationwide.</strong> Instead of being unable to get a job in one state for being wrongly registered as a child abuser, one will be unable to get a job anywhere in the country.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>
<strong>Should this bill pass, our state-level reforms to keep innocent names off these lists will become just that much more important.</strong> Though we have resisted this “national registry” and will continue to do so, yet these state reforms can limit (though not entirely eliminate) the damage such a system would cause.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>The Unknown</strong>
</h2>



<p>While those are the highlights we know so far, the bill is over 100 pages long and repeatedly references and amends the current version of CAPTA, making reading and understanding this proposal a long process.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>To put it simply, there is still a lot in the bill we do not know.</p>



<p>
<strong>We will be studying this bill further to find all the hidden nuggets, both good and bad.</strong>&amp;nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>The Prognosis</strong>
</h2>



<p>Given the split nature of the current Congress, a bill with this kind of bipartisan support is likely to pass, at least in the House. At this point, we have no indication of what the Senate committee thinks of these reforms.</p>



<p>But if the bill is going to pass, there will be opportunities between now and then to bring about at least minor changes to its content. <strong>We are already in discussion with coalition partners to schedule a (virtual) meeting with Congressman Scott</strong> and his staff to address those parts of the proposal that concern us.</p>



<p>We will be doing all we can to make the most of our opportunities so that the final bill will protect families from unnecessary intrusion while still protecting vulnerable children from abuse or neglect.</p>



<p>If you are in a position to help us in this effort, you can do so through your gift to ParentalRights.org here.</p>



<p>Thank you for standing with us as we defend families, protecting children by empowering parents.</p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>

<![CDATA[<p>As 45 states start their legislative sessions this month, now is the time for you and me to push lawmakers to champion necessary child welfare reform.</p>



<p>Last summer, we presented model language for a bill that would provide due process <em>before</em> a name goes on a child abuse registry. Volunteers in more than a dozen states reached out to their lawmakers with that proposed reform.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>If you are one of those volunteers, <strong>now is the time to follow up on those contacts </strong>and encourage your lawmakers to support this legislation.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>If you haven’t yet volunteered, <strong>now is a great time to step up and join the effort with a call or email to your state senator or representative (delegate, or assemblyman).</strong>
</p>



<p>Many states will be friendly to parental rights legislation this year, as parents and lawmakers alike have been sensitized to family needs by the challenges of 2020. What’s more, our model was drafted by a coalition of family-policy experts and family-defense attorneys from both sides of the aisle. This means <em>any state could be in play for this reform.</em>
</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>Why This Reform Is Needed</strong>
</h2>



<p>In a majority of states—far too many—all it takes to add a name to the state’s child abuse registry is the agreement between a child welfare investigator and his or her supervisor. In some states, even the supervisor is optional!</p>



<p>This means parents who have had their children taken away and then returned by order of a family court judge are still having their names added to the list of offenders. And <strong>many more parents’ names are added without ever getting a hearing before any judge or magistrate at all.</strong>
</p>



<p>Last year, we were able to help two families, <a href="https://parentalrightsfoundation.org/innocent-parents-removed-from-abuse-registry-in-new-york/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one in New York</a> and <a href="https://parentalrightsfoundation.org/turning-around-a-no-win-situation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one on the West Coast</a>, whose names were added to the list of child abusers by a state agent <strong>who just didn’t like the parents’ decisions</strong>. In both instances, the Parental Rights Foundation was able to intervene and get their names removed. &amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>
<strong>But they should never have been added in the first place.</strong>
</p>



<p>Our common sense reform will protect families by preserving their reputations: keeping the names of innocent parents off the list of child-abusers. It will also save states money by reducing the number of appeals, 80% of which today end in having the name removed anyway.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>Why Now?</strong>
</h2>



<p>The time to bring legislation to your lawmaker varies by state, depending on when the legislature convenes and whether bills have to be prefiled.</p>



<p>January is an important month in many states, because <strong>45 state legislatures convene this month, and three more convene on February 1 (NV, OK) or February 2 (AL)</strong>. (California and Maine both convened ceremonially in December, but their sessions begin in earnest in January; they are counted in the 45.)&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Of the states convening in January, seven start today (January 13), and five more (AK, HI, NM, OR, UT) will convene next week.</p>



<p>
<strong>It is vital to introduce legislation early in the session,</strong> both to maximize the time our bill has for passage and to make sure we don’t miss important deadlines in the long legislative process.</p>



<p>There is one caveat to this timing: If bills had to be prefiled, then lawmakers may not be able to introduce anything new at this point. Check with your lawmakers to find out if this requirement applies to them.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>Make a Difference</strong>
</h2>



<p>If your state doesn’t require that bills be prefiled, <strong>now is a great time to reach out to your state-level senator or house member and urge them to take up this important legislation</strong> before the session is too far gone.</p>



<p>All you need to do to get the ball rolling is download the model from <a href="https://parentalrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Central-Registry-Reform-Model-Legislation-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our website here</a>, then send it to your lawmakers with the request that they look it over and consider championing it this legislative session.</p>



<p>If you are willing to take that step, <strong>please email </strong>
<a href="mailto:Michael@parentalrights.org">
<strong>Michael@parentalrights.org</strong>
</a>
<strong> before reaching out to your lawmakers, so we can coordinate efforts in your state.</strong>&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>As I mentioned at the start of this email, efforts have already been started in 13 states: Arizona, Colorado, Minnesota, Missouri, North Carolina, New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and West Virginia.</p>



<p>
<strong>If your state is on this list</strong>, we could still very likely benefit from your reaching out to your lawmakers and encouraging them to support the legislation.</p>



<p>
<strong>But if your state is not on the list, we could definitely use your help to begin an effort where you live.</strong>
</p>



<p>As your legislature gets cranked up for 2021, will you be the one to step forward and take action in your state?</p>



<p>Working together, we can make a positive difference for families by protecting good and innocent names from your state’s misused child abuse registry.</p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>

<![CDATA[<p>We knew there would be challenges ahead of us with the start of the 2021 legislative season this week. We were preparing for them.</p>



<p>
<strong>But crunch time is no longer coming; crunch time is here.</strong>
</p>



<p>In preparation for the new COVID vaccines <strong>DC passed a law on December 23 that puts 11-year-olds in the position to grant legal consent for vaccines, over the wishes of their parents.</strong> Even worse, the dangerously misguided law adds provisions to see to it parents <em>never find out</em> their child got the vaccination.</p>



<p>Think about it.</p>



<p>The law actually ensures that a parent <em>will not know</em> their child’s full medical history.</p>



<p>
<strong>The medical provider who supplies the vaccine is prohibited from noting it on your child’s regular medical record</strong>, even if he or she is not your child’s regular physician. This means your child’s doctor will be as in the dark as you are.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Record of the vaccination will instead be forwarded to your child’s school, where they will keep it on file—but not in any of the records that they share with you.</p>



<p>
<strong>The insurance company billed for the expense is even prohibited from providing an Explanation of Benefits (or EOB) to the insured, who presumably would be the parent.&amp;nbsp;</strong>
</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>Dangerous for Children</strong>
</h2>



<p>Now, ParentalRights.org doesn’t hold a specific position on the safety or efficacy of vaccines. But that doesn’t even matter in this case.</p>



<p>Every one of us should be deeply concerned by a law that so cuts parents out of their child’s medical decision that the parents—and even the child’s family physician!—are completely blinded to what has happened to their child, even after the fact. </p>



<p>We saw some bills in 2020 that would allow 16- and 17-year-olds to override their parents’ decisions if they want to get one or two particular vaccines their parents don’t agree with.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>But this law is so far beyond even that threat to family privacy and parents’ rights.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Not only does this law drop the age from a 16-year-old potential driver to an 11-year-old <em>elementary school student</em>, but it also puts the pressure of a decision on that child for any and every vaccine of which the parent disapproves.</p>



<p>No child should be put in the position of being asked by adults to go directly against a choice that their parent has already made to protect them.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>There are other problems with the law, too, like whether its provisions to hide the deed violate the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) or other federal laws. But we don’t need to wander into the weeds there, either.</p>



<p>The simple fact is, <strong>this law removes parents from their child’s healthcare to an unprecedented degree,</strong> leaving formative young pre-teens to muddle through <em>on their own</em> without the support or guidance of those who know them (and their family medical history!) and love them best.</p>



<p>And, even more disturbing, it will set a precedent that we know other states will follow.</p>



<p>Because if DC can get away with it, well-intentioned (or perhaps well-funded) lawmakers in other states will want to get away with it, too.</p>



<p>
<strong>But all is not lost yet.</strong>
</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>Our Fight in Congress</strong>
</h2>



<p>You and I have one final legislative chance to stop this law.</p>



<p>When a DC bill is signed by the mayor, or when the mayor chooses not to veto a bill within a given 10-day window as in this case, that bill becomes law.</p>



<p>But it also goes to Congress, where it sits for a review period of 30 legislative days—a review period during which Congress can pass a joint resolution to veto it. If Congress passes such a resolution and the president signs it, the new DC law is repealed.</p>



<p>And that is where this nightmare provision stands today.</p>



<p>It is time for this battle to be waged in Congress.</p>



<p>
<strong>It’s a battle for our children’s safety that we cannot afford to lose.</strong>
</p>



<p>That’s why ParentalRights.org has already been talking with members of the US House and Senate, planning who will file the veto resolution and when. We are working on securing bipartisan support, especially in the House, to get the resolution through both chambers quickly.</p>



<p>We only have 30 legislative days to work with, so we can’t move at Congress’s normal, snail-slow pace. <strong>We jumped on this just as soon as it cleared the mayor’s office, and we’re expecting a bill number at any hour.</strong>
</p>



<p>It’s an urgent and vital need. And it’s not the only challenge facing us in 2021.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>There’s More Going On&amp;nbsp;</strong>
</h2>



<p>Starting this week, lawmakers all over the country are convening for their next legislative sessions. As they do, we will see another onslaught of bills like we did in 2020—bills that would threaten your parental rights.</p>



<p>We will see bills that want to redefine “abuse” to include disagreeing with the political viewpoint adopted by your state.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>We will see bills that limit, not the methods, but the aims of psychological and gender identity care you and your child can seek together. (Thankfully, a 2–1 decision by the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in <em>Otto v. City of Boca Raton</em> could help reduce the number of these bills.)</p>



<p>We will see more bills, like this one from DC, that would make children of younger and younger ages responsible for their own mental health, vaccine, or other healthcare decisions if the state doesn’t like the choice parents already made.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Those bills give no reciprocating freedom to a child who disagrees with the state<em> and </em>their parents, only those who disagree with their parents. Because the aim is not to give children more freedom, <strong>but to strip them of their parents’ guidance so the child can be swayed to do the state’s bidding.</strong>
</p>



<p>And that’s exactly why parents are so important.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>Knowing What Matters</strong>
</h2>



<p>While government bureaucrats just want to get the children to do what <em>the state</em> thinks is best, you and I know that <em>parents</em> will naturally decide and act based on <em>what is best for their child’s individual needs</em>.</p>



<p>The belief you hold, that a parent’s natural desire is to care for their child, is why there will also be bills introduced in 2021 <strong>to preserve the vital parent-child relationship we hold so dear</strong>.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>We’re already preparing to stand with lawmakers to bring a parents’ bill of rights in Florida. (We will be working closely with lawmakers and volunteers in Indiana, too, but that bill may not be introduced until 2022. Stay tuned and I’ll let you know.)</p>



<p>And we’ll be working alongside volunteers and lawmakers in as many as a dozen states to provide due process to parents before their name goes on a child abuse registry.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>Staying the Course</strong>
</h2>



<p>These positive efforts to protect families are encouraging, but they won’t be easy.</p>



<p>You and I must be ready to fight for these bills, just as we’re fighting against the negative bills listed above.</p>



<p>Efforts like these, to halt the bad legislation like the DC vaccine bill and to promote good legislation like the Florida Parents’ Bill of Rights, are why we’re here.</p>



<p>There is literally <em>no other national organization</em> in America focused entirely on parental rights. <strong>If we don’t stand up for the role of parents, no one will.</strong>
</p>



<p>You know this. It’s why you believe in us, and why you’ve supported us in the past.</p>



<p>Can I count on you today to make your <a href="http://parentalrights.org/donate">very best donation </a>to ParentalRights.org to fuel these efforts in 2021?</p>



<p>Together, we can halt bills like the DC vaccine law and we can preserve parental rights in more than a dozen states just in the coming months.</p>



<p>Together, we can make the country a little safer for parents, safer for families, safer for our children, one state at a time.</p>



<p>Thank you for standing with us with your <a href="http://parentalrights.org/donate">most generous gift</a> of $15, $35, or even $125 today.</p>



<p>With your partnership, we will continue to protect children by empowering parents through 2021 and beyond.</p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>



<p>Michael Ramey<br>Executive Director </p>



<p>PS—The dangerous minor consent law in DC is just one of the challenges to parental rights either on the table now or coming in 2021. But good bills will be introduced, too. <strong>Together, we can protect the vital role of parents in the lives of their children, state by state, bill by bill.</strong> Will you partner with us through your gift today to help us win these battles in the new year ahead?</p>

<![CDATA[<p>The DC bill allowing minors to consent to vaccination without their parent’s knowledge or consent, the bill that would keep any knowledge of the vaccination from the child’s parents even long after the fact, has finally been delivered to the desk of DC Mayor Muriel Bowser.</p>



<p>If you live in the District, we would ask that you call the Mayor’s office today and urge her to veto the bill, DC 23—171. You can call her office at&amp;nbsp;(202) 727-2643 or email <a href="mailto:eom@dc.gov">eom@dc.gov</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>Background</strong>
</h2>



<p>Bill DC 23-171 passed the DC Council on second reading on November 20 by a vote of 10-3. We do not know why its delivery to the mayor’s office was delayed by two weeks, but we understand this is not unheard of under the current leadership.</p>



<p>
<strong>Regardless of the reason for the delay, it has helped us prepare to battle the bill in Congress.</strong> And a veto of the bill, even if it is ultimately overridden by the Council, would result in even more time to recruit the congressional champions we need to ultimately halt this terrible idea.</p>



<p>And that’s if the veto is overridden. From first reading to second reading, the vote already improved from a 12 to 1 majority to only a 10 to 3 majority<strong>. If only two more votes could be swayed by our efforts—to an 8 to 5 vote—the majority would no longer be sufficient to override the veto.</strong>
</p>



<p>What this bill does:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Permits <strong>children as young as 11 years old</strong> to give legal consent for vaccination if the vaccine is government approved and the parents have  opted out of it for their child.</li>
<li>
<strong>Prohibits the administering medical provider from documenting the vaccine</strong> in the vaccination section of the child’s normal medical record.</li>
<li>Requires the administering provider to submit the vaccination record directly to the child’s school.</li>
<li>Prohibits the school from including this vaccination record with the rest of the child’s educational record.</li>
<li>
<strong>Prohibits the school from providing this information to the child’s parent</strong>.</li>
<li>
<strong>Prohibits any insurance provider from sending an Explanation of Benefits (or EOB) indicating the vaccination</strong>.</li>
</ul>



<p>This scheme is designed to keep the child’s parents in the dark about the vaccine permanently and would keep the child’s family physician just us much in the dark as the parents are. How can any parent take proper care of their child in that situation?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>Take Action</strong>
</h2>



<p>
<strong>If you live in DC, please call Mayor Bowser’s office today at (202) 727-2643 and urge her to veto DC 23-171.</strong>
</p>



<p>If you do not live in DC, stay tuned. Unless a veto is successful and the Council fails to override it, we anticipate having to fight this bill through a congressional veto resolution in the coming weeks. At that point we will <em>all</em> have a part to play in making that effort a success.</p>



<p>Thank you for standing with us to protect children by empowering parents to make the best medical decisions for their family!</p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>



<p>Michael Ramey<br>Executive Director</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Over the last few weeks, we have been tracking a bill in DC that would not only permit 11-year-olds to give legal consent for a vaccination against their parents’ wishes, but also prevent medical professionals, school officials, and even your insurance from telling the parents about it—even after the fact.</p>
<p>
<strong>Parents in the District will still be responsible for their child’s health and well-being, but without even the basic knowledge of what vaccinations their child has or has not received.</strong>
</p>
<p>Yet, despite our phone calls and emails expressing concern, the bill passed the DC Council by a vote of 10 to 3 on November 20, and it’s headed to the mayor’s office.</p>
<p>As we explained earlier, the bill can be signed or vetoed by the mayor—she has 10 days to decide—and then it goes to Congress for a 30-day legislative review period, during which Congress can veto the bill by passing a resolution against it.</p>
<p>And we are already working with members in both the House and Senate to get such a resolution introduced and passed in those 30 legislative days.</p>
<p>Because, as you know, [FNAME], if this bill is allowed to stand in DC, it’s only a matter of time before it will be duplicated in <em>your state</em>, too.</p>
<p>
<strong>And it will directly threaten your ability to make wise and informed health-care decisions for your children, whom you love with all your heart.</strong>
</p>
<p>How can you keep them safe when you don’t even know what has been done to them?</p>
<p>That’s why ParentalRights.org is continuing our efforts to stop this troubling bill and others like it that will come up in the 2021 legislative session, starting in January.</p>
<p>
<strong>To combat these threats, we are aiming to raise $90,000 this #GivingTuesday, which is today, December 1.</strong>
</p>

	


	
		
	<p style="text-align: center;">Generous donors have already given a $45,000 matching grant to DOUBLE your #GivingTuesday gift. So your gift of $15, $35, or $125 today to protect families by preserving parental rights can have TWICE the impact until the match is met!</p>

	


	
		
			<a href="https://secure.parentalrights.org/survey.jsp?surveyId=55&amp;" target="_self" class="fl-button">
							<span class="fl-button-text">Give Today</span>
					</a>

	


	
		
	<p>Your gift to <a href="/donate">ParentalRights.org</a> or your tax-deductible gift to our sister organization, the <a href="http://parentalrightsfoundation.org/donate">Parental Rights Foundation</a>, will go a long way to fueling our efforts in the coming year.</p>
<p>Efforts to block harmful legislation that would take your children out of your control and place them in unknown danger.</p>
<p>Or Foundation efforts to remove the names of innocent parents from child abuse registries where they never belonged in the first place.</p>
<p>Or efforts to keep a father and daughter together, like the case the Foundation supported at the Texas Supreme Court.</p>
<p>
<strong>Real people. Real families. Real lives.</strong>
</p>
<p>Can they count on you to stand with them today?</p>
<p>The deadline to double your gift is 11:59 p.m. on Tuesday, December 1—that’s TODAY!</p>
<p>
<strong>Make<a href="https://secure.parentalrights.org/survey.jsp?surveyId=55&amp;"> your gift </a>
</strong>
<strong>to protect children by preserving #parentalrights this #GivingTuesday, and your gift will be DOUBLED until the $45,000 matching donations are met.</strong>
</p>
<p>Thank you for your most generous response today!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Michael Ramey<br>
Executive Director</p>
<p>
<strong>P.S.—Reminder:</strong> In just a few hours, we will be sending out an email you can forward to family and friends to introduce them to the issues threatening your—and their—parental rights. <strong>When you get that email, please forward it along to grow our voice for families together!</strong>
</p>

<![CDATA[<p>
<strong>Our rights and our families are in danger, and I’m hoping you can help.</strong>
</p>



<p>It’s only natural that children flourish best when they are raised and cared for by their parents, the people who know and love them best.</p>



<p>And while the vast majority of parents are good and loving, our government has systems in place to step in when there is concern for a child’s safety.</p>



<p>The problem is, those systems are not perfect, and <strong>now the flaws are hurting innocent families.</strong>
</p>



<p>
<a href="https://parentalrights.org/two-little-boys-one-big-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The overzealous application of these systems has <strong>removed thousands of children from <em>good families</em>
</strong> </a>and <strong>
<a href="https://parentalrightsfoundation.org/innocent-parents-removed-from-abuse-registry-in-new-york/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">put the names of <em>innocent parents</em> on child abuse registries</a>.</strong> The pain and trauma from these events—no matter how brief—can last a lifetime.</p>



<p>But it doesn’t stop there. As the system continues to wrongfully remove children from their parents, lawmakers are also working to pass legislation that <strong>puts bureaucrats between you and your child</strong> and <strong>
<a href="https://parentalrights.org/minnesota-to-end-all-private-education/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">takes away your rights and responsibilities</a>
</strong> as a parent.</p>



<p>We cannot blindly trust the system anymore. <strong>We have to do something to protect our children.</strong>
</p>



<p>
<strong>So I’m reaching out to you today because you know the importance of family.</strong>
</p>



<p>Especially in this holiday season, it is difficult to imagine being apart from the ones you love most in this world. Yet, that separation is reality for <strong>over 400,000 American children.</strong>
</p>



<p>That’s why <strong>ParentalRights.org and the Parental Rights Foundation are working to help protect innocent families.</strong> And I’m hoping you will help, too.</p>



<p>ParentalRights.org is a 501(c)(4) non-profit that fights against dangerous legislation and works to pass good legislation that protects innocent families like yours and mine. And the Parental Rights Foundation is a 501(c)(3) that educates the public on this issue and helps individual families who are fighting for their rights in the court system.</p>



<p>In this fight for our families, <strong>every voice matters.</strong>
</p>



<p>Here’s how you can add your voice to the growing chorus:</p>



<p>1. <a href="https://parentalrights.org/get_involved/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Subscribe</a>&amp;nbsp;– Sign up for <a href="https://parentalrights.org/get_involved/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our email list here</a> and follow us on social media. That will help you stay up to date on concerning legislation, encouraging success stories, and any urgent need for action.</p>



<p>2. Pass it on – As I said, <strong>every voice matters</strong>, so share this email with your friends and family to raise awareness about this important issue.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>I’m writing to you today with a special request from our team at ParentalRights.org.</p>



<p>#GivingTuesday is coming December 1, and we need your help.</p>



<p>As you might have read in <a href="https://parentalrightsfoundation.org/celebrate-giving-tuesday-with-the-parental-rights-foundation/">our last newsletter</a>, this isn’t just <em>any </em>#GivingTuesday.

<p>Those are great things, and our team is excited to make it all come together!</p>



<p>But I have a special request for you in order to make that happen.</p>



<p>
<strong>On #GivingTuesday—December 1—I will send you another email designedfor you to share withthose who may have<em> never thought about this crucial issue</em>,</strong> and with your friends already somewhat familiar with parental rights. The email’s content will be targeted so that it can be easily forwarded or otherwise passed along.</p>



<p>
<strong>It is a critical part of our #GivingTuesday efforts, because #GivingTuesday isn’t just about raising money.</strong>
</p>



<p>One of our main goals this #GivingTuesday is to raise awareness for an issue that you and I both hold dear, one that affects <em>every </em>American citizen. So, I ask you, one of our most faithful supporters, to please <strong>
<em>plan now to open that email and pass it along to as many as you can.</em>
</strong>
</p>



<p>ParentalRights.org’s #GivingTuesday will only be a success with your help.</p>



<p>So, for the families you and I helped this year, and the families we need to help next year, please plan to share the email we send you on #GivingTuesday.</p>

<p>The world is a very different place today than it was last year, but thanks to you we are weathering the storm.</p>



<p>We are grateful that we have been able to draw attention to dangers like DC Bill 23-171 and Tennessee’s child ‘wellness checks,’ that we’ve been able to help more families this year than ever before, and that now those families can enter the holiday season with hope and the chance to heal.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>[Update 11/18: The Council voted 10 to 3 yesterday to pass this dangerous bill. It will be going to the mayor for signing and then sit for a review period before Congress, as described below.]</p>



<p>The DC bill that would allow 11 year olds to consent to vaccinations was scheduled for second reading and final vote yesterday, November 10, but was postponed until next week, the 17th. This bill poses a serious threat to parental rights and to the safety of children and could set a dangerous precedent for states to follow.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>Harmful to Children</strong>
</h2>



<p>Introduced last year by Councilmember Cheh, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://lims.dccouncil.us/Legislation/B23-0171" target="_blank">B23-171</a>, <strong>the “Minor Consent for Vaccinations Amendment Act of 2019,” would allow children as young as 11 to give legal consent to receive a vaccination that their parent has opted out of on religious or other grounds.</strong>
</p>



<p>[Editor’s note: Read our earlier release about this bill <a href="https://parentalrights.org/dc-council-would-discard-constitution-end-parents-rights/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> for more info.]</p>



<p>The bill ostensibly limits consent to only those children who are deemed able to make an informed decision, but <strong>the medical provider offering the vaccination, not the parent, will be making that judgment call.</strong> This creates a conflict of interest for the doctors and puts the child at risk of authority-figure coercion, to which children are already especially susceptible.</p>



<p>
<strong>B23-171 also restricts information about the child’s vaccination status from getting to parents.</strong> In the interest of protecting children from abuse by parents angry about their decision, the bill prohibits the insurance company from sending an Explanation of Benefits, it <strong>prohibits the vaccinating provider from placing the vaccine in the child’s medical record</strong>, it requires them to instead notify the child’s school directly, and it prohibits the school from releasing that information to the parents.</p>



<p>So if a child should suffer an adverse reaction or a vaccine-related injury, <strong>neither the parents nor the child’s regular physician would have any way of knowing the child had even received the vaccine.</strong>
</p>



<p>Such a policy would not only violate the constitutional and natural right of parents to care for their children, but it would also put the lives of impressionable young children at risk. Protecting children from these dangers is the very reason loving parents exercise such rights in the first place!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>The DC Process</strong>
</h2>



<p>A bill proposed by the DC Council must be read and voted on twice, then go to the mayor, who may veto the bill. If the bill is not vetoed, or if the council subsequently overrides a veto, then the bill goes to Congress for a review period of 30 legislative days. During that time, Congress can veto the bill with a joint resolution that receives a majority vote in each chamber, which is then signed by the president.</p>



<p>Given the veto-proof majority on the first B23-171 vote, we do not anticipate the council voting it down next Tuesday, nor a mayoral veto. <strong>So we are ramping up efforts to get Congress to pass a veto resolution. </strong>We have a majority champion in the Senate ready to go, and we are working with allies and volunteers to secure a majority champion in the House to do the same.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, time is short, so we will have to act fast—if the bill passes next week, as expected.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>Why the Delay?</strong>
</h2>



<p>I would love to tell you this postponement came about because the Council heard so much pushback they are afraid to move the bill forward. Sadly, that is not the case.</p>



<p>
<strong>Council Member Gray proposed </strong>
<a href="https://lims.dccouncil.us/downloads/LIMS/42000/Other/B23-0171-Gray_Amendment_-_B23-171.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
<strong>an amendment</strong>
</a>
<strong> to add a sentence to the bill in order to notify insurance companies that they are not to send an Explanation of Benefits to parents.</strong> Without his amendment, insurance companies were to keep parents in the dark, but no one was responsible to tell them that. This amendment simply makes sure they “get the memo.”</p>



<p>However, Council Member Gray was absent from yesterday’s meeting and could not answer questions about his amendment. His absence alone caused the week-long delay.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>Setting a Dangerous Precedent</strong>
</h2>



<p>If DC B23-171 survives the legislative review period—if we fail to get a veto resolution passed—it will become law in DC, setting a precedent for other states to follow.</p>



<p>And they will follow. <strong>We already saw similar bills introduced in a half-dozen states in 2020</strong>, though these involved older ages and had no provisions for hiding the vaccination from parents. If the DC bill passes, though, I have no doubt at least some of these will come back in 2021, following the DC example.</p>



<p>To prevent the spread of this legislative blight, we must stop this DC bill from becoming law. So be prepared, because <strong>in the next few weeks, we are going to need to call on you to reach out to your senators and member of Congress and urge them to support the veto resolution.</strong>
</p>



<p>We will know more once we have a sponsor in the House and once Mayor Bowser acts on the bill, and we will keep you updated.</p>



<p>Thank you for standing ready with us to halt this dangerous legislation and keep our children safe.</p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>

<![CDATA[<p>
<strong>On October 20 the District of Columbia Council voted 12-1 to adopt a measure that would flout existing Supreme Court precedent and end parental rights regarding a minor’s healthcare.</strong>
</p>




<a class="wp-block-button__link" href="/donate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Donate</a>




<p>
<a href="https://lims.dccouncil.us/Legislation/B23-0171">Bill 23-171 </a>is scheduled for a second reading and vote in the council on November 10. If it passes again, it then faces Mayoral review and a 30-day congressional review before it becomes DC law. Given the current over-whelming support, the bill is likely to pass the second vote. A mayoral veto, if there were one, would likely be overridden. But congressional rejection of the bill would still kill it out-right.</p>



<p>
<strong>That’s where you and I come in.</strong>
</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>A Dangerous Bill</strong>
</h2>



<p>For nearly 100 years, consistent Supreme Court precedent has held that <strong>parents have both the duty and the right to direct the care, custody, and control of their minor children.</strong> But Bill 23-171, proposed by Councilwoman Cheh and cosponsored by a majority of the council, would defy that precedent, stripping parents not only of the authority to make a decision, but <em>even to know about the decision being made</em>.</p>



<p>The bill, proposed October 7 in the Committee on Health, would declare, “A minor, eleven years of age or older, may consent to receive a vaccine where the minor is capable of meeting the informed consent standard, and the vaccine is recommended by the United States Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)…”</p>



<p>To meet the “informed consent standard,” the bill says the minor must be “able to comprehend the needs for, the nature of, and any significant risks ordinarily inherent in the medical care.”</p>



<p>But nowhere does the bill indicate <em>who</em> determines if the child is able to comprehend these factors. It is a safe bet it isn’t going to be the child’s parent.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>Contrary to the Constitution</strong>
</h2>



<p>Such a provision flies in the face of existing Supreme Court precedent, specifically on the issue of adolescent care and informed consent.</p>



<p>In its 1979 <em>Parham v. J.R.</em> decision, the Supreme Court declared:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>&amp;nbsp;“Simply because the decision of a parent is not agreeable to a child, or because it involves risks, does not automatically transfer the power to make that decision from the parents to some agency or officer of the state. The same characterizations can be made for a tonsillectomy, appendectomy, or other medical procedure. <strong>Most children, even in adolescence, simply are not able to make sound judgments concerning many decisions, including their need for medical care or treatment.</strong> Parents can and must make those judgments.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Bill 23-171, which flies in the face of this very clear ruling, would necessarily be unconstitutional as a result. Through this bill, the council would make the vaccine decision, overruling fit and loving parents—and <em>hide</em> from the parents what has been done!</p>



<p>And make no mistake. <strong>It is the council making the decision, not the 11-year-old child.</strong> If the bill were handing authority to the child, it would permit <em>any</em> decision, including that of a child to opt out of immunizations whose parents wanted the child inoculated. <strong>This bill only empowers one action: for a child to receive a vaccine which the government says is best for the child and which the parent says is not.</strong>
</p>



<p>The court in <em>Parham</em> continued, “The fact that a child may balk at hospitalization or complain about a parental refusal to provide cosmetic surgery does not diminish the parents’ authority to decide what is best for the child.&amp;nbsp;<em>Neither state officials nor federal courts are equipped to review such parental decisions</em>”(Internal citations omitted, emphasis added).</p>



<p>Yet, under Bill 23-171, the DC Council would take that authority for itself.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>Sneaking Around to the Child’s Detriment</strong>
</h2>



<p>Shockingly, this unconstitutional (and unconscionable) usurpation of parental authority is not the only concern we have with the bill.</p>



<p>
<strong>Bill 23-171 also contains deeply disturbing provisions to keep the vaccination a secret from the parents.</strong>
</p>



<p>First, the bill specifies that, although providers shall seek reimbursement from the insurer without parental consent, they “shall not send an Explanation of Benefits (EOB) for services provided” under the bill. In other words, <strong>the parents’ insurance will have to pay for the shot, but the parent will receive <em>no notice</em> of the charge.</strong>
</p>



<p>Second, <strong>the bill would <em>require</em> falsifying the child’s medical records</strong> regarding the vaccination. Specifically, the bill requires a health care provider administering the vaccines to “leave the immunization record in Part 3 blank, and…submit the immunization record directly to the minor’s school.”</p>



<p>
<strong>So the child’s medical record (which parents can often read) <em>will not show the immunization</em>; but that secret will be held at the child’s school.</strong> Then the schools are instructed to “keep this immunization record confidential, except it may share the record with the Department of Health or the school-based health center.”</p>



<p>
<strong>So your insurance carrier, a medical provider, and your child’s school can know your child’s immunization history, but you cannot.</strong> Good luck providing the ER doctor with the best information in the event your child is ever in a life-threatening accident.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>Not about the Vaccines</strong>
</h2>



<p>Now, I understand there is a lot of disagreement even among parental rights supporters when it comes to vaccines. ParentalRights.org has no medical position on the safety or efficacy of the vaccines involved in this bill.</p>



<p>Rather, we hold unswervingly to the belief that <strong>fit and loving parents are the best people to make informed medical decisions on behalf of their children</strong>. Not judges. Not teachers. Not doctors. Not the minor children themselves.</p>



<p>And certainly not the DC Council.</p>



<p>
<strong>If we lose the authority as parents to make these decisions because vaccines are a hot-button topic right now, what parenting decision will be next?</strong> If the government establishes that it can override a parent’s wishes by citing a government review board and “allowing” a minor to make the government-approved decision (only), soon every “parenting” decision will be subject to just this kind of rule.</p>



<p>No, this is not about the vaccines<strong>. This is about who will make medical decisions for your minor children—you, or the government.</strong>
</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>Standing Up for Parental Rights</strong>
</h2>



<p>Based on the <em>Parham</em> ruling, there is no conceivable way Bill 23-171 could survive a constitutional challenge. Yet, with twelve out of 13 council members voting in favor of the bill, its passage November 10 is all but assured.</p>



<p>We must call on Congress to take a stand.</p>



<p>
<strong>If you live in the District of Columbia, take a moment today to contact your councilmembers and urge them to oppose this bill on second reading</strong>, even if they voted in favor the first time. Tell them it would defy the constitutional right of parents to make informed medical decisions for their own children. Tell them you know they’re not giving any power to children except to make the one choice the council has approved.</p>



<p>You can find your DC Councilmember’s <a href="https://dccouncil.us/councilmembers/">contact information here</a>.</p>



<p>If you don’t live in DC, you cannot affect the council vote directly. Instead, <strong>we must prepare to call on Congress</strong> in the coming days or weeks.</p>



<p>
<strong>And we must be vigilant for any similar measure to be introduced in <em>your</em> state this January.</strong>
</p>



<p>Setting aside your vaccines view for a moment if necessary, educate yourself on this issue. <strong>This is about the authority of parents to know about, let alone make, medical decisions for their child.</strong>
</p>



<p>Then, educate those around you. Warn them of this dangerous DC bill, and show them the lengths some localities will go to to rob parents of their rightful authority.</p>



<p>And be prepared to answer the call to oppose such bills. <strong>When Bill 23-171 goes to Congress, or if this issue pops up in your state, we will let you know.</strong> Then it’s up to you to contact your lawmakers and make sure these unconstitutional power grabs never see the light of day.</p>



<p>Finally, if you are able, give today to ParentalRights.org so that we can remain vigilant and get word to you when it is needed.</p>



<p>Thank you for standing with us against overreach in its many forms, to protect children by empowering the fit parents who know and love them best.</p>



<p>Sincerely, </p>

<![CDATA[<p>Mark your calendars and spread the word!</p>



<p>On <strong>Thursday, October 15<sup>t</sup>
</strong>
<sup>h</sup> ParentalRights.org Board Member and PA State Coordinator, Vickie Suarez, will be speaking at the “Believe me! I’m a mother!” rally at Philadelphia City Hall and <strong>you are invited to attend!</strong>
</p>



<p>The rally starts at <strong>9:00 a.m. at Philadelphia City Hall’s Northeast Entrance</strong>, and <strong>protests Philadelphia’s out-of-control Child Protective Services</strong>, challenging them to shift their focus to keeping families together.</p>



<p>
<strong>Your attendance at this rally is crucial</strong> because the more people attend, the more our cause is heard and taken seriously by lawmakers who have the power to make change for good!</p>



<p>You and I know that too many of these abuse accusations are either <strong>blatantly false</strong> or only cases of less-than-perfect parenting. And when children are removed from those loving homes they are not being helped by the change; <strong>they are traumatized</strong>.</p>



<p>In a country with many unnecessary removals, Philadelphia has a particularly bad reputation.</p>



<p>So we’re rallying to tell them that <strong>children are safest with fit, loving parents, and the Philadelphia child welfare system needs to stop tearing apart good families.</strong>
</p>



<p>
<strong>Stand with us and with Vickie to fight for families on October 15<sup>th</sup>!</strong>

<![CDATA[<p>Vanessa Peoples knows all too well about parental rights abuses. She was a 25-year-old nursing student when <strong>a “wellness visit” to check on her children turned into an all-out assault on her family and home.</strong> <em>And none of it was called for.</em>
</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://reason.com/2020/09/24/aurora-police-hogtied-child-services-abuse/">this article by Diane Redleaf at Reason</a>, the story began in June 2017 when Peoples and her two children, ages 2 and 4, enjoyed a gathering with about 15 relatives at a local park. When Peoples’ youngest followed a departing cousin toward her car, <strong>a passerby assumed the child was unattended, grabbed him, and called the police.</strong> Peoples was there immediately and demanded the woman let the boy go, but she refused.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>Police on the Scene</strong>
</h2>



<p>When the police arrived, they, too, demanded Peoples prove she was the boy’s mother, even as he was continually reaching for her and calling her “mom.” Finally, with several relatives lending support to Peoples’ claim, the “child rescuer” relented and returned the boy. The police cited Peoples for child neglect and departed.</p>



<p>Already, this should not have happened. The police dispatch could easily have said, “the mother is there now? Then let the child go to his mother.”</p>



<p>Barring that, the police arriving on the scene could have done the same thing. <strong>To cite a mother for neglect because a child wandered from her sight at a park among relatives for a period of “about a minute” (according to reports) is uncalled for.</strong>
</p>



<p>But the police rejected any appeal to common sense and gave Vanessa a citation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>She Didn’t Hear Them Knock</strong>
</h2>



<p>Fast forward about four weeks, and a child welfare investigator is at Vanessa’s door. Only Vanessa has no idea.</p>



<p>The investigator knocked, but Vanessa didn’t hear her. She had just bathed the kids and was in the basement doing laundry.</p>



<p>When one of the boys leaned out a first floor window, still naked from his bath, the investigator phoned a supervisor, and then the police. She feared the children were unsupervised, home alone.</p>



<p>When police arrived, mom was still in the basement with the washer and dryer running. She didn’t hear them when they entered her home—without a warrant or probable cause—and came looking for her.</p>



<p>She was startled when she came up the stairs to find police officers with guns pointed at her. She explained that she is hard of hearing in one ear and that she did not hear them knock, and <strong>at that point, any cause they had for entering her home evaporated.</strong>
</p>



<p>The children were not unattended. They were not home alone. They were not in any danger.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>It Never Should Have Happened</strong>
</h2>



<p>At that point, the investigator or any one of the officers could have said, “we see the children are not unattended. <strong>We have no warrant and we no longer have grounds for concerns of imminent danger</strong>, so we’re going to step outside and start again, asking for permission to enter.”</p>



<p>Only none of them did that, either.</p>



<p>Instead, they investigated the home, noting that the children were undressed, the door was unlocked, the front screen was loose, and there was “little food in the pantry.” Distraught, Vanessa called her mother—Patricia Russell, with whom Vanessa lived—and asked her to return home quickly from a doctor’s appointment.</p>



<p>The invaders were just wrapping up their exploration when Russell arrived home, understandably angry, and insisted they leave her house. (It is worth repeating here that they had no warrant, and by this time no probable cause of any imminent danger.) Officers refused, and continued giving orders.</p>



<p>Russell took one of the children into a bedroom to get him clothed, but an officer wouldn’t let her shut the door. <strong>A power struggle was escalating, and Vanessa attempted to step in, joining her mother in the bedroom.</strong>
</p>



<p>Instead, she was wrestled to the floor, hogtied, and literally carried out to a police cruiser. <strong>Officers actually dislocated her shoulder in the process of hogtying her, and emergency medical personnel had to be called.</strong>
</p>



<p>And I repeat yet again, none of this should have happened.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>The Aftermath</strong>
</h2>



<p>Fortunately, Peoples got a good lawyer and sued the county, who settled out of court. <strong>Her dislocated shoulder was a dead giveaway that they did not want the case going to trial.</strong>
</p>



<p>But to keep her children, Vanessa was forced to plead guilty to child endangerment, which will no doubt be a severe hurdle to her career options when she finishes nursing school. <strong>All over something that was never neglect in the first place.</strong>
</p>



<p>Had just one of these officers or investigators recognized Vanessa’s rights as a mother, including her Fourth Amendment right to be secure in her person and in her home, this entire trauma could have been avoided.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>Parents Don’t Have to Be Perfect</strong>
</h2>



<p>Yes, Vanessa’s child toddled away at a picnic. She lost sight of him for about a minute. But who among us hasn’t had that happen?</p>



<p>Fortunately for all of us, the US Supreme Court has more than once held <strong>that parental rights do not evaporate simply because someone is not a perfect parent. </strong>“Neglect” does not mean turning your back for a minute and having to chase down your child. “Neglect” is a willful act of abandonment, of failing (by choice) to provide for your child when you have the means to do so.</p>



<p>But the police in Aurora, Colorado failed to recognize that, and Vanessa’s two children were traumatized. According to the Reason article, <strong>“The government’s well-being check on Peoples’ children left them with nightmares and a fear that the cops could come, tie up, and take away their parents.”</strong>
</p>



<p>In the name of child protection, they left the children devastated.</p>



<p>That is why parental rights must be protected from government overreach, and how protecting parents’ rights protects children, as well.</p>



<p>Thank you for standing with us as we work to protect the right of parents like Vanessa from the kind of overreach she experienced, and to protect children from the kind of nightmares her children now endure.</p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>

<![CDATA[<p>It’s hard to see 2021 from here, what with another full month of hurricane season, elections looming in November, fires raging out west, and unrest continuing in cities across the nation.</p>



<p>Yet we are excited to be working with <strong>volunteers in 16 different states</strong> on securing lawmakers to introduce parental rights legislation in the coming 2021 session.</p>



<p>
<strong>I am uniquely excited about Florida, where a full-fledged Parents’ Bill of Rights (PBR) will again be introduced.</strong> Rep. Erin Grall proposed the PBR in 2020, and it received strong bipartisan support. Minority Democrats stood shoulder-to-shoulder with their Republican colleagues in committee hearings that were positively encouraging to watch online.</p>



<p>Sadly, the bill failed to pass the Senate Judiciary Committee on the final day of hearings, held up by the leadership over petty politics.</p>



<p>But we are excited for 2021 because, <strong>while we expect that same bipartisan support to still be in place come January, the leadership that held us up will no longer be in the way. </strong>So I anticipate an exciting victory in Florida this coming year!</p>



<p>What’s more, a couple of other states may be considering similar legislation moving forward.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>15 States to Eye Registry Reform?</strong>
</h2>



<p>Most of the state-level efforts for 2021 are currently more modest, however (as is fitting to their current political landscape). <strong>In 15 states, volunteers are contacting their senators and representatives about reforming the child abuse registry law to protect innocent families.</strong>
</p>



<p>You will <a href="https://parentalrightsfoundation.org/turning-around-a-no-win-situation/">recall the story out of Oregon</a> about how Doreen’s name was added to the abuse registry for not taking her toddler to the ER after a tumble down the stairs. The child had calmed right down and never acted hurt, but hours later, the child couldn’t seem to settle down at bedtime.</p>



<p>It turns out the baby was struggling to digest foods new to her diet. But before the baby passed gas and settled down, Doreen called a nurses hotline about her fall. The nurse called child welfare services when mom and baby failed to show at the ER. <strong>The baby immediately got a clean bill of health from a pediatrician, but the investigator added Doreen’s name to the registry anyway.</strong> (Her name has since been removed.)</p>



<p>Our model aims to stop injustices like this from happening again. And while we’d love to see this fixed at the federal level (amending the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act could immediately fix this in all 50 states), Congress has made that impossible.</p>



<p>
<strong>Instead, states like Colorado, Missouri, and Pennsylvania will consider making this vital correction for themselves. </strong>Other states where volunteer efforts are under way include Arizona, Hawaii, Iowa, Minnesota, North Carolina, New Jersey, Oregon, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and Washington.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>What You Can Do</strong>
</h2>



<p>To start the process in your state, all you need to do is <strong>download our model language</strong> <a href="https://parentalrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Central-Registry-Reform-Model-Legislation-1.pdf">from the Parental Rights Foundation website here</a>
<a> </a>
<strong>and forward it to your state lawmaker</strong>.</p>



<p>With elections in just a few weeks, odds are it’s not great timing to expect an immediate response from them, but you could send it now and promise to check back with them after the election in November.</p>



<p>Then, <strong>follow up and ask them to sponsor the legislation in the coming session</strong>. It’s a matter that will easily gain support from both sides of the aisle, allowing your lawmaker, from whichever political party, to take the lead on an issue that matters to parents.</p>



<p>I would also ask that you <strong>let me know you’re reaching out</strong>, so that I can coordinate your effort with those of other volunteers in your state to give us the best opportunity for success.</p>



<p>Working together, we can make 2021 a terrific year for preserving parental rights in your state!</p>



<p>So, please consider taking this opportunity to reach out to your lawmakers to bring change, and add your state to the list of 15 where this effort is already under way!</p>



<p>Thank you as always for standing with us to protect children by empowering parents, and by protecting their names from the stigma of an unjust listing on the child abuse registry.</p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>

<![CDATA[<p>The Tennessee Department of Education issued a letter this weekend <strong>completely withdrawing child wellbeing guidance</strong> that last week caused a tremendous outcry due to parental rights and family privacy concerns.</p>



<p>That letter, addressed to the Tennessee legislature and forwarded to us by one of our friends there, <a href="https://parentalrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TN-DoE-Response-Letter.pdf">is attached here.</a>
</p>



<p>Last week’s policy guidance, created by the Child Wellbeing Task Force, set a goal for government agents to make contact with every child in the state. We cautioned that such a policy, if adopted, would threaten the right of parents to be presumed to act in their own child’s best interests. The policy would have treated every parent like a suspected child abuser.</p>



<p>The response letter states, <strong>“Governor Lee has asked our department to remove the guidance document and go back to the drawing board so we get this right.</strong>
</p>



<p>“I want to assure you that we recognize the concerns that you and your constituents share, and we realize why those concerns exist…. I also acknowledge the vast difference between providing support for vulnerable children as opposed to any potential overreach into what parents determine is best for their children.”</p>



<p>(Their stated intention of providing support for vulnerable children is, tragically, necessary and a valid goal for state government.)</p>



<p>At this point, we have every reason to believe the letter is sincere, and that future steps to protect vulnerable children will not intrude on the rights of fit, loving parents to uphold their family’s privacy.  <strong>We count this as a win for parental rights and for all families in your state.</strong>
</p>



<p>In Tennessee as in every other state, however, we must remain vigilant against such threats as may arise in the future.</p>



<p>Thank you for standing with us to protect children by empowering parents, in Tennessee and across the country.</p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>

<![CDATA[<p>On August 11, the Tennessee Child Wellbeing Task Force (“Task Force”) published “<a href="https://parentalrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Wellbeing-Checks_Publication-with-homeschool-children-included-1.pdf" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">a guidance document</a>” through the Department of Education “to ensure all children are checked-in (sic) on.” The document calls on localities to mobilize their resources to “connect with each child to verify wellbeing and identify need.”</p>



<p>
<em>(BREAKING: While building this alert email we have also been working the phones. First we learned <strong>the Guidance Document has been removed from the Department of Education website</strong>, and we have now learned the Governor’s office is rethinking whether to put it back up. <strong>They need to hear from all Tennessee residents</strong>, and we all need to remain vigilant against similar efforts in other states who may choose to follow the example they initially set.)</em>
</p>



<p>The guidance document lays out the goal that “ALL Tennessee children will receive a wellbeing check” (emphasis in original, page 1), “child” being defined on page 4 as “birth through the completion of grade 12 if enrolled in school or 18 years of age. School-age children includes those who are enrolled in public schools, private schools, homebound, etc.”</p>



<p>The effort sounds altruistic and good. <strong>Who could be against making sure the children are okay?</strong>
</p>



<p>But every year millions of families are caught up in child welfare investigations, an overwhelming 83% of which <strong>turn out to be false.</strong>
</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>Why We’re Concerned</strong>
</h2>



<p>This policy guidance is not benign. It radically increases the number of innocent families unnecessarily coming to the attention of an already overloaded and ineffective child welfare system, and <strong>it will disproportionately affect the poor and minorities, as well.</strong>
</p>



<p>It will hurt the poor because poverty is often confused with “neglect.” Nationwide in 2018 (the last year for which data is available), <strong>more than 60% of all child removals cited “neglect” as the only reason for intervention.</strong> Yet actual, willful neglect is extremely rare. The balance of those cases are families who need help, not separation.</p>



<p>And the policy will disproportionately harm families of color, because these already face an increased level of involvement when compared to their share of the population at large. According to federal government data <a href="https://parentalrightsfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TN_DisproportionalityReport2017_PRF.pdf" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">
<strong>gathered by the Parental Rights Foundation </strong>
</a>for 2017, <strong>African-Americans and Native Americans make up a portion of the child welfare population in Tennessee that is more than one-and-a-half times their portion of the child population in the state</strong> (1.59 and 1.51 times, respectively). Spreading a wider net will only catch more innocent families <strong>based only on the color of their skin.</strong>
</p>



<p>The guidance document exposes a presumption by the Task Force that <strong>fit parents cannot be trusted</strong>, and <strong>that we must rely first and foremost on state and local agents to keep children safe.</strong>
</p>



<p>This flies in the face of the legal presumption set forth by the U.S. Supreme Court in <em>Parham v. J.R.</em>, 442 US 584 (1979), that “natural bonds of affection lead parents to act in the best interests of their children.”</p>



<p>So while the guidance sounds good and purports to be in the interest of children, it would use the closure of Tennessee public schools as an excuse to bring a government agent into contact with every home in the state. And every contact will involve someone <strong>trained to look for any excuse to call your family in.</strong>
</p>



<p>Here are a few things every concerned parent needs to know:</p>



<p>1. The “guidance” comes from the state, but its implementation will depend on the localities, <strong>each of which will apply its own procedures.</strong> Some may be more onerous than others. Some may ignore the “guidance” completely.</p>



<p>2. “Contacts” listed in the guidance include surveys, emails, phone calls, virtual calls, school-based visits, or home visits. <strong>Not all localities will choose to employ home visits, but they are certainly on the list.</strong>
</p>



<p>3. The data which the Task Force hope to gather includes a “complete roster of all children (birth through grade 12) in the city/district/county,” categorized by whether they are “enrolled in school…, homebound, children too young to attend school, [or] children not enrolled in any school.” <strong>The intended scope is not limited to local public school students.</strong>
</p>



<p>4. Parents have a right under the Fourth Amendment “to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.” This right extends to your privacy and to your children. <strong>You do not have to answer questions or let them in.</strong>
</p>



<p>5. The guidance itself notes that if “the guardian does not provide permission to speak with the child, then the parent, guardian, or care taker (sic) may speak on the child’s behalf.” However, <strong>if a parent declines to let the child be interviewed directly, <em>this will be noted and included in the data to be gathered</em>.</strong>
</p>



<p>6. The guidance makes clear that the preference of the Task Force is for the state or local agent to speak to each child personally and even privately. While the guidance also instructs the agent to accept “No” for an answer (while taking names), <strong>the <em>ideal</em> is to speak to the child, as though no parent can be trusted.</strong>
</p>



<p>This is a breaking story, and one we are watching closely for any new developments<strong>. We are concerned, too, that it could be a harbinger of things to come. </strong>As society adopts new ways of doing things, many states may look for ways like this to take advantage of the situation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>Take Action</strong>
</h2>



<p>What can you do to halt this overreach into your fundamental rights as a parent?</p>



<p>1. <strong>Tennessee parents should reach out to your governor</strong>, elected officials, or local school board and express your concerns about these recommendations. You can find contact information through this <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://hslda.org/legal/legislation?vvsrc=/campaigns/76614/respond" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">convenient summary page</a> made available by HSLDA.</p>



<p>
<em>(Note: We have learned the Governor’s office has taken the Guidance down and is planning to revisit it before deciding whether or not to put it back up. So do <strong>be friendly with your call, but be sure they hear from you.</strong>)</em>

<![CDATA[<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE // August 13, 2020 // Washington, D.C. – On Friday, Rep. Gwen Moore (D-WI) introduced a bill on the floor of the US House, which would suspend a federal provision that generally requires states to file for Termination of Parental Rights (TPR) against parents whose children have spent 15 or more of the last 22 months in foster care or other state custody.<br>
<br>Moore’s bill is H.R. 7976, the “Suspend the Timeline Not Parental Rights During a Public Health Crisis Act.”<br>
<br>Proponents of the bill, who hail from all sides of the political spectrum, argue that suspending the arbitrary timeline just makes sense in this season of unintended and often-inescapable delays caused by reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic.<br>
<br>“Before the pandemic, many of these children would have been returned to their families,” Jey Rajaraman, chief counsel for the Family Representation Project, Legal Services of New Jersey, said for a press release from the Congresswoman’s office. “But agencies have been unable to provide the services needed to facilitate reunification. We should not allow this pandemic to lead to unnecessary permanent termination of parent-child relationships.”&amp;nbsp;<br>
<br>Andrew Brown, with the Texas Family Policy Foundation, agrees. “Parents who were diligently working services required to provide a safe, stable home for their children suddenly, and through no fault of their own, found themselves unable to access these services due to COVID-19 pandemic-related lockdowns. . . . A temporary suspension of termination timelines gives these parents a fair opportunity to restore their families and honors their decision to take personal responsibility by doing the hard work necessary to achieve reunification.”<br>
<br>“Termination of parental rights has been called ‘the death penalty of the family courts,’” adds Michael Ramey, executive director of ParentalRights.org. “By no means should we race to inflict it on families just because they had the extreme misfortune of being separated, often by overzealous state actors, in a time when COVID-19 alone prevents reunification.”<br>
<br>The Children’s Bureau of the US Department of Health and Human Services has urged states to employ an exemption for special circumstances; that exemption is already written into the federal law that created the guidelines in the first place, but many states are not making use of it. This leads to virtually random results from state to state—and often from judge to judge.<br>
<br>“Congress made this mess by putting this arbitrary guideline into the Adoption and Safe Families Act in the first place,” Ramey says. “Now it’s time for Congress to clean up their mess, by providing clear guidance for states to employ common sense instead.”</p>

<![CDATA[<p>For so many of us, it seems like 2020 is the year that will never end. From COVID-19, to killer hornets, to hurricanes, to COVID-19 . . . yes, I already mentioned that, but it just <em>keeps going on</em>.</p>



<p>
<strong>How are you holding up?</strong>
</p>



<p>It’s been tough, I know. My own 2020 has been a rough roller-coaster ride, as well.</p>



<p>But in the middle of all this I’m comforted knowing <strong>there are parental rights victories to celebrate</strong> <strong>and ongoing efforts working to achieve even more.</strong>
</p>



<p>Last week we told you about<a href="https://parentalrightsfoundation.org/we-won-one-texas-familys-victory/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the <strong>victory in the Texas Supreme Court</strong>
</a> that keeps the decision-making authority for one little girl with her father, where it belongs.</p>



<p>And we told you two weeks ago about <a href="https://parentalrightsfoundation.org/parental-rights-goes-to-alec/">our successful outing with the American Legislative Exchange Council,</a> which opens the door for <strong>conservative support of our child abuse registry-reform model in the states.</strong>
</p>



<p>I’m happy to report that <strong>efforts are already underway in a dozen states to see that model introduced. </strong>And with five full months before the 2021 legislative session starts, I expect we’ll see more states added to that list.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>Putting a Hold on TPR</strong>
</h2>



<p>We are also working with our bipartisan coalition partners to <strong>introduce legislation in Congress that will suspend an important federal guideline that is proving detrimental to families,</strong> especially in these days of COVID-19.</p>



<p>Under the American Safe Families Act, a state must generally file for termination of parental rights (TPR) to any child who has spent at least 15 of the last 22 months in state custody (usually in foster care). This is an arbitrary and often-unhelpful limit on parents who are making real strides toward reunification, <strong>but it is <em>especially harmful </em>during the pandemic, when every step in the reunification process moves at a snail’s pace.</strong>
</p>



<p>Due to lockdowns, families are not able to get in their visitation time, parenting classes are online only (a problem for poor families without internet access) or not available at all, and many other necessary meetings or even court hearings are suspended or delayed.</p>



<p>Under such conditions, <strong>holding fast to the 15-month limit simply makes no sense.</strong>
</p>



<p>So, along with our allies from across the political spectrum, <strong>we are working to introduce a bill in Congress that will put a hold on that limit, thereby giving families a fighting chance to survive the COVID-19 storm.</strong> And with bipartisan support, it’s the rare sort of bill that might actually stand a chance in a strongly divided D.C.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>Standing Together</strong>
</h2>



<p>Yes, the year has been long. <strong>But it is not without hope.</strong> I sincerely hope you are finding the bright spots in your own family, just as we are able to find these bright spots in the campaign to protect your parental rights.</p>



<p>
<strong>Together, we will achieve the victory if we do not lose heart.</strong>
</p>



<p>We are with you—your family is in our thoughts and prayers through this challenging year as we continue to fight for your rights. And we thank you for standing with us, as well.</p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>



<p>Michael Ramey<br>Executive Director</p>

<![CDATA[<p> </p>
<p>The American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) voted last week to adopt model legislation presented by the Parental Rights Foundation that would require due process before a parent’s name can be added to a state’s child abuse register.</p>
<p>According to their website, ALEC “is America’s largest nonpartisan, voluntary membership organization of state legislators dedicated to the principles of limited government, free markets and federalism.” <strong>Nearly a quarter of America’s state lawmakers are members of ALEC, making it an ideal place for us to share policy and legislative ideas that fit their purpose.</strong>
</p>
<p>Since protecting parental rights involves limiting government, our issue falls easily within the bounds of what ALEC members will consider.</p>
<h2>The Presentation</h2>
<p>
<strong>So last week, I attended the ALEC annual conference to present our model on child abuse register reform.</strong> In a nutshell, the proposal would require due process before a parent can be listed on a state’s child abuse register.</p>
<p>I began the presentation with last month’s story of the mother in Oregon who was added to the state’s child abuse register for <em>not</em> giving her daughter medical attention the child <em>did not need</em>. (You may have read that account in <a href="https://parentalrightsfoundation.org/turning-around-a-no-win-situation/">our article here.</a>)</p>
<p>I explained that when families like the one in Oregon are put on the register without cause and without a chance to defend themselves, they are forced to appeal. And how does that go?</p>
<p>According to the decision of the Second Circuit US Court of Appeals in <em>Valmonte v. Bane</em>, <strong>“nearly 75% of those who seek expungement of their names from the list are ultimately successful.”</strong>
</p>
<p>And while that is good news for the three-quarters being removed, that figure highlights a serious flaw in the system: as the court in <em>Valmonte</em> casually understated it, <strong>“The fact that only 25% of those on the list remain after all administrative proceedings have been concluded indicates that the initial determination made by the local [Department of Social Services] is at best imperfect.”</strong>
</p>
<p>Our model, which requires some showing of proof before a name can be added, will correct this major flaw, resulting in fewer names on the list and a greatly reduced number of expensive appeals.</p>
<h2>Bipartisan Support</h2>
<p>
<strong>The ALEC task force assigned to our model voted immediately to support it.</strong> This means any member of ALEC—which, again, includes nearly 25 percent of all state legislators in the US—is encouraged to take our model back home and introduce it in the 2021 legislative session.</p>
<p>Many Democrats have been pushing for child welfare reform for years. To have the Republican-friendly ALEC join their cry is a significant achievement and one we want to fully use.</p>
<h2>Action Item</h2>
<p>So, wherever you live, whether your legislature is red or blue, you can bring this model to your state in 2021. Here’s all you need to do:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong> Send me an email</strong> (<a href="mailto:Michael@parentalrights.org">Michael@parentalrights.org</a>) and let me know you’re interested in getting this to your lawmaker. Be sure to let me know which state you’re in. This will let us coordinate and avoid duplicating our efforts. (If four different lawmakers from one state all unknowingly prepare the same model, they’ll be irritated at us for wasting their time. Instead, we should get them all working together from the start.)</li>
<li>
<strong> Download the model language from our website<a href="https://parentalrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Central-Registry-Reform-Model-Legislation-1.pdf"> here</a>
</strong>
<strong>.</strong> You’re welcome to familiarize yourself with it, but don’t feel you have to. It is enough to have it on hand to forward to your lawmaker in step 4.</li>
<li>
<strong> Contact your lawmakers in the state house or senate</strong> and ask them to take up this important reform for the 2021 session.</li>
<li>Tell them you’re a constituent calling to suggest they take up an important reform to keep innocent parents off your state’s child abuse register.</li>
<li>Share a story. Share with them the story of the mom in Oregon. Or share your own story if you have one.</li>
<li>Offer to send them a model they can use as a starting point. <strong>If they’re a Republican</strong>, you can tell them the model has been vetted and adopted by ALEC, as well.</li>
<li>
<strong>If they’re a Democrat</strong>, you can tell them the model was written by a bipartisan coalition. (Martin Guggenheim of NYU School of Law and other such solid liberal thinkers as Richard Wexler at National Coalition for Child Protection Reform and Diane Redleaf of Family Defense Consulting are among its authors.) Its endorsement by ALEC just means they can easily get a cosponsor from across the aisle.</li>
<li>
<strong> Send them the model language</strong>, and let them know they are welcome to contact me (<a href="mailto:Michael@parentalrights.org">Michael@parentalrights.org</a>) if they have any questions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thank you for taking action to bring this important reform to your state. Together, we can protect parents all over America from the terrible injustice of being listed among the guilty while they are innocent.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Michael</p>

<![CDATA[<p>On June 24, President Trump issued an executive order on the use of federal funds related to the child welfare system. ParentalRights.org federal relations liaison Maggie McKneely gives us her take on the order in this week’s newsletter.</p>
<p>While the directive is something of a mixed bag, <strong>we are especially excited about the attention it gives to methods and resources designed to keep innocent families together.</strong> Perhaps most useful is its focus on “high-quality legal representation,” because<strong> good legal counsel has been shown to keep more families together</strong> and to reunify families more quickly if they are divided.</p>
<p>It turns out, giving parents a lawyer who will actually listen to them and help them (instead of overworked court-appointed counsel whom the parents meet three minutes before their hearing) actually goes a long way in <em>protecting families.&amp;nbsp;</em>
</p>
<p>Here’s Maggie’s summary of the order:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">In the year 2020, it’s important to celebrate any good news we get. And for a refreshing change of pace, we have good news to report out of Washington DC.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Many of the issues in the broken child welfare system are directly tied to the federal government. <strong>Bills such as The Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA) have enabled states to deprive parents of proper due process,</strong> overburdened the system with faulty anonymous reporting, and ensnared parents in seemingly endless, intrusive investigations. So when the feds take it upon themselves to reverse course a bit and fix some of these issues, it’s important to give credit where credit is due.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Late last month, the president issued an executive order that seeks to protect children by improving the child welfare system. While <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/06/29/2020-14077/strengthening-the-child-welfare-system-for-americas-children">Executive Order No.13930</a> is broad and leaves most of the details to be determined and implemented by the federal Department of Health and Human Services, there are still some encouraging details that proponents of change can praise.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Much of the executive order is dedicated to improved data collection, so that the federal and state governments can better allocate funds where the money is most needed. This data will also be used to develop <strong>community-based prevention and family-support services, all aimed at keeping children with their families.</strong>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">The most significant portion of the order is Section 5. This section includes a number of items designed to prevent the unnecessary removal of children from their homes or, in such cases when it is deemed necessary, to ensure that those children who are removed will be placed in permanent, stable households as soon as possible.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">The order also directs HHS to provide guidance to states on using funds to provide families and children with <strong>high-quality legal representation “to prevent the removal of children from their families</strong>, safely reunify children and parents, finalize permanency, and ensure that their voices are heard and their rights are protected.”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Because the executive order is general in nature, it will be some time before we see any immediate impact from it. <strong>But it’s refreshing to see government officials acknowledge the flaws of the current system and take steps to address them.</strong>
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">At ParentalRights.org, we know that protecting families isn’t a partisan issue. Regardless of party, race, or religious ideology, every parent should have the right to act in the best interest of their kids. So we applaud the actions taken by the current administration in this arena and continue to encourage lawmakers from both parties to protect children and preserve parental rights.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Maggie McKneely,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Federal Relations Liaison</p>
<p>We will monitor the results of this executive order as it is carried out, and we will continue to stand, as always, for your parental rights.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Michael</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Well, it looks like they’ve finally done it.</p>
<p>We’ve been watching for it all along, hoping against hope that the System would prove us wrong and somehow behave itself. But <strong>we kept watching, because we know what the System is made of.</strong>
</p>
<p>Sure enough, it appears it has finally happened.</p>
<p>“Today in dependency court madness, LA County Dept. of Children and Family Services (DCFS) recommended that <strong>the court remove my client’s child from their physical custody after the parent tested positive for COVID-19.</strong> This is a non-offending parent. The judge ruled in favor of DCFS and detained.” (emphasis added)</p>
<p>So says a Los Angeles-area attorney<a href="https://www.facebook.com/cborzin/posts/853776773738"> in a post on Facebook last week.</a> (We have not yet been able to confirm the case, but the lawyer’s account remains live on Facebook.)</p>
<p>He continues, “Let that sink in . . . DCFS is asking for children to [be] removed from their parents’ custody due to COVID-19 <em>despite the parent making the appropriate arrangements for their child.</em>” (emphasis added)</p>
<p>To be clear, right now we are talking about one child in one courtroom. The family, who we understand are working on filing a writ of habeas corpus to have their child returned, hasn’t had time yet to finish that writ, let alone file for a full appeal.</p>
<p>However, <strong>once there is one rotten ruling, it becomes easier for others to follow.</strong>
</p>
<p>Some of you have been sounding alarms ever since reports came out that child welfare forms were changed to indicate COVID-19 was present in the home at the time of the child’s removal.</p>
<p>Our analysis at the time was, and remains, that the change in the form was not intended to make COVID-19 an excuse for separating families. It was intended as a means to warn a potential foster family or group home that an in-coming child has been exposed to the virus.</p>
<p>But, like so many of you, we also saw the potential for danger, and we have kept our ear to the ground. Sure enough, now an LA County judge has just been accused of taking the plunge down the rabbit hole.</p>
<p>To state the matter plainly,<strong> the government has no authority to remove a child from their private home simply because the child or a parent has contracted COVID-19.</strong>  This is especially true if, as indicated by this family’s lawyer, <em>the parents have made appropriate arrangements</em> to see to it the child can be taken care of somewhere away from the infected parent.</p>
<p>In such instances, there is absolutely no need for the court to even be involved.</p>
<p>
<strong>This is not—this <em>will not be</em>—the new normal.</strong> Under no circumstances will we stand by while innocent families suffer the humiliating and life-shattering trauma of unnecessary, unconstitutional, <em>unconscionable</em> separation.</p>
<p>We are working to know more about this situation, and we will certainly stay vigilant in watching for more instances, and for tracking what happens in this case.</p>
<p>Thank you for joining us in this fight. <strong>Standing together, we will make sure this does not become “the new normal.”</strong> Families have a right to be together; let’s make sure <em>that right is protected</em>. </p>

</b> Today we added to this page a link to the Facebook post so you can see for yourselves. As mentioned earlier, we have not yet been able to verify this beyond Facebook. But there are two additional points to consider regarding its reliability:</p>
<p>First, there is an attorney database by which attorneys can look each other up. We checked that database and verified that the original Facebook author, who claims to be an L.A.-area attorney, <b>is in fact an L.A.-area attorney.</b> This alone adds a lot of credibility.</p>
<p>Second, <b>multiple other attorneys have weighed in among the comments</b> on his post, saying they’re facing similar challenges. Now that you can access that through the link above, you’ll be able to see some of those comments for yourself. </p>

<p>
<strong>Attempts to verify this story have failed.</strong>
</p>
<p>From the outset, we were clear that the story appeared in a Facebook post, and that all we could verify of it was that it had been posted by an actual lawyer and commented on by other lawyers. We warned that we were not yet able to verify the story.</p>
<p>We made statements, however, that were stronger than called for: “They’ve finally done it…. It has finally happened.” <strong>These gave the appearance we held the story to be true, even while we presented it as unconfirmed.</strong> We now regret the use of these bold statements.</p>
<p>
<strong>Since then, all our attempts to verify the account have been unsuccessful.</strong> For this reason, we are compelled to edit the article and notify our readers that it remains an unconfirmed Facebook post only. Let the reader beware.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>We’ve known it for years: extreme self-identified “experts” will argue away your right to make the best decisions for your child.</p>
<p>We knew it last year when Dr. Barbara Knox, who was put on administrative leave from her Wisconsin hospital for bullying colleagues into supporting child abuse allegations–even in the absence of any medical evidence–ended up instead as the head of a specialty child abuse clinic in Alaska.</p>
<p>We knew it in 2017 when College of William and Mary professor James Dwyer declared, <strong>“The reason the parent-child relationship&amp;nbsp;<em>exists</em>&amp;nbsp;is because the&amp;nbsp;<em>State</em>&amp;nbsp;confers legal parenthood on people through its paternity and maternity laws”</strong> (emphasis added).</p>
<p>We knew it years before either of these, when Harvard University professor Elizabeth Bartholet wrote in her seminal work, <em>Nobody’s Children</em> (2000), that the reason for racial disparity in child welfare is not that states take too many minority children from their parents, but that <em>the system doesn’t take away enough white children</em>.</p>
<p>
<strong>And recently we could see them actually coming together to stage a coordinated attack.</strong>
</p>
<p>These three—Knox, Dwyer, and Bartholet—are among several elitist speakers who were slated to present their radical, anti-family views at an invitation-only, anti-homeschooling conference that, before the pandemic shut it down, was to be held at Harvard in June.</p>
<p>Now, let me be clear: <strong>if you think this is only about homeschooling, you haven’t been paying attention. </strong>Maybe take a moment to reread the first several paragraphs of this letter and see the dots that this conference would connect.</p>
<p>
<strong>Medical power. Legal authority. And the might to traumatize children by separating them from their homes.</strong>
</p>
<p>The conference, which will no doubt be rescheduled, is about homeschooling in its title and on its surface only. These elites are coming for your children, period. <strong>They are coming for the power to dictate how every child in America is to be raised.</strong>
</p>
<p>Raised to act, look, and–especially–to think, not only “just like everyone else,” but just like Bartholet, Dwyer, and Knox.</p>
<p>In a recent article in the <em>Arizona Law Review</em>, and in an even more recent interview in the <em>Harvard Times</em>, Bartholet makes their intentions plain.&amp;nbsp; In both, she calls for “a presumptive ban on homeschooling,” which would require parents to seek permission before exercising their internationally recognized “prior right to decide the kind of education that will be given to their children” (<em>Universal Declaration of Human Rights</em>, Article 26.3, 1948).</p>
<p>If they get their way—if we are not there to halt their draconian plans for our children—<strong>your right to shape your children in freedom according to your own convictions and beliefs will be taken away forever.</strong>
</p>
<p>From the beginning, the family has been the backbone of American freedom, stability, and even innovation. From its earliest case on the subject, the Supreme Court has held that “[t]he child is not the mere creature of the State; those who nurture him and direct his destiny have the right, coupled with the high duty, to recognize and prepare him for additional obligations.” <em>Pierce v. Society of Sisters</em>, 268 U.S. 510 (1925) at 535</p>
<p>But that’s not all the Court said. They declared, <strong>“The fundamental theory of liberty upon which all governments in this Union repose excludes any general power of the State to standardize its children by forcing them to accept instruction from public teachers only.”</strong>
</p>
<p>This freedom, this opportunity for independence of thought and belief, is not only an American ideal (contrary to Bartholet’s position), but “<em>the</em> fundamental theory of liberty upon which all governments in [the United States] repose.”</p>
<p>
<strong>To lose this freedom would be no small loss to our country.</strong>
</p>
<p>The Supreme Court understood that, with enough power, a government can train children so that in adulthood they will willingly lay aside their right to bear arms, their freedom of press, and even their freedoms of religion and speech.</p>
<p>
<strong>Your right to pass on your values to your children is the lone bastion that keeps the government from shaping the next generation into servile subjects, willing to lay aside any other rights we now hold dear. </strong>
</p>
<p>Bartholet and her colleagues are actively pursuing exactly what the Supreme Court declared they must not have: a general power of the State to standardize its children by forcing them to accept only state-sanctioned instruction.</p>
<p>Imagine. You can keep your children, love them, raise them. But this band of elitists will decide what they learn for more than 30 hours every week, regardless of where they go to school or who is doing the teaching.</p>
<p>
<strong>No freedom of ideas. No diverse opinions. No exceptions.</strong>
</p>
<p>Once your child is an adult, how much will they still think and believe as you do? How much will they still share your values and convictions? For that matter, how will they even be able to think for themselves?</p>
<p>To Bartholet and the others, that doesn’t matter. Because there are racists, and sexists, and others out there promoting poor values, these scholars want to take away your parental freedom to instill your good values and your child’s right to a solid worldview foundation. They would throw out the good of your liberty and your child’s future freedoms to get rid of the ills of racism and the like.</p>
<p>But that is not how our country works, nor how it was intended to work. As the Supreme Court declared in one of my favorite decisions, <strong>“The statist notion that governmental power should supersede parental authority in all cases because some parents abuse and neglect children is repugnant to American tradition.”</strong> <em>Parham v. J.R.</em>, 442 U.S. 584 (1979), at 603.</p>
<p>For Bartholet and Dwyer, it is the tradition that should be thrown out, and not their statist views. In her <em>Arizona Law Review</em> article, Bartholet identifies as a “barrier” “the emphasis in the language of the Constitution on protecting individual rights against state action.”</p>
<p>Maybe this should be a clue: if the Constitution of the United States is keeping you from doing what you want to do, maybe the people don’t want you doing it in the first place.</p>
<p>In conclusion, their Harvard conference is not just about homeschooling. And ParentalRights.org is not just about parental rights, either. Our current stand protects every right, every freedom, from extinction in a single generation.</p>
<p>
<strong>This parental rights movement, made of ParentalRights.org and our allies, is the only bastion standing in the way of Bartholet’s plans for our children.</strong> And you are the only source empowering this vital defense.</p>
<p>That’s because ParentalRights.org is funded entirely by private donors just like you. Without your generous support, we would not exist, and there would be virtually no one standing in Harvard’s way.</p>
<p>
<strong>The climb is steep, but the need is great. </strong>
</p>
<p>Can I count on you to make a difference with<a href="http://parentalrights.org/donate"> your most generous donation</a> of $20, $50, or even $100 today? We cannot stand up to Bartholet and her ilk without you.</p>
<p>Thank you for standing with us to defend the Constitution—and the families it protects—from these shocking attacks by arrogant academic elites.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Michael Ramey<br>Executive Director</p>
<p>P.S. <strong>Elitists like Bartholet, Dwyer, and Knox aren’t looking to protect your children</strong>; they’re looking to shape them into a likeness of the elitists’ own choosing. If they get their way, it’s not just your family that will be affected; <strong>the foundations of American society can crumble in a generation.</strong> <em>Will you join us today as we continue the fight to stop that from happening and to keep good families free?</em> Their symposium on homeschooling is just another thinly veiled attempt to take away your rights as a parent and your child’s right to your protection. We must fight back.</p>

										<content:encoded>
<![CDATA[<p>Last week ParentalRights.org sent a letter to congressional leaders urging them to reject any boost to Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA) funding unless Congress is ready to make serious changes to how the program works.</p>
<p>Given that the entire mission of ParentalRights.org is “protecting children by empowering parents,” <strong>nothing could be of greater concern to us than programs inflicting harm on society’s most vulnerable—our children.</strong> Yet, as it stands, our government is spending millions of dollars to fund programs that cause more harm to children and families than they prevent. And that is unconscionable.</p>
<p>CAPTA is a “carrot” program used since 1974 to provide federal spending incentives for states who adopt child maltreatment programs according to the specified guidelines.</p>
<p>For instance, <strong>today every state has a child abuse hotline because their CAPTA funding depends on it. </strong>For the same reason, they all have child abuse registries and follow a number of other congressionally determined rules.</p>
<p>Lately, Congress has been looking at a proposal that would greatly increase the amount of money going through CAPTA—money flowing to the states in recognition of, and to facilitate the states’ adherence to, CAPTA guidelines. When I say “greatly increase,” I mean they’re looking to roughly <em>triple</em> the funding.</p>
<p>
<strong>But there are serious flaws in the CAPTA program—flaws that traumatize millions of children in innocent families; tripling the funding would only magnify those flaws. </strong>
</p>
<p>So we wrote a letter to the leaders of every party in each chamber of Congress: Representatives Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) in the House and Senators Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Chuck Schumer (D-NY) in the Senate.</p>
<p>Our letter, <a href="https://parentalrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/CAPTA-Letter-to-Congressional-Leadership.pdf">
<u>which you can read here</u>
</a>, highlights three problems in particular that must be addressed before we spend even one more dollar in CAPTA funding.</p>
<h4>
<strong>“Confidential” Rather Than “Anonymous”</strong>
</h4>
<p>
<strong>First, anonymous reporting must be eliminated.</strong> It was through CAPTA’s establishment of child abuse hotlines that anonymous reporting became such a major part of reality all over the country. To receive funding, a state must have a hotline and a means by which someone can call in a report without revealing their identity to the alleged abuser.</p>
<p>But, as one might expect, such a system has become “weaponized.” <strong>Everyone from busybody in-laws to disgruntled exes in nasty divorces—even strangers off the street!—can place a call, put you in hot water, and never face any consequences of their own.</strong>
</p>
<p>Nationally, only four percent of anonymous hotline calls —that’s <em>one in 25</em>—result in a substantiated finding of abuse or neglect.</p>
<p>This problem can easily be addressed by requiring that the caller, while remaining anonymous to the alleged abuser, provide identifying information to the hotline operator. This “confidential reporting” would cut down tremendously on the number of false and malicious calls going into the system and would allow the states to identify and prosecute those who repeatedly make reports in bad faith.</p>
<h4>
<strong>“Off-Ramp” for Pointless Investigations</strong>
</h4>
<p>Second, open-ended investigations should likewise cease. Currently, CAPTA calls for certain details to be reviewed any time a family is brought to the attention of a child welfare organization, and <strong>states have added their own items to this laundry list.</strong> In essence, every anonymous call can quickly turn into a full review of everything in your house—even if none of it has anything to do with the allegations against you.</p>
<p>To correct this problem, we called for common sense “off ramp” measures that <strong>allow an investigator to halt any investigation once it is determined the hotline call was false.</strong>
</p>
<p>A case our own Jim Mason was involved in some time ago through his work with Home School Legal Defense Association is helpful to illustrate this point. A mom called in because an investigator was at the door and wanted to see the house and the children. Mom explained that <strong>the hotline had apparently received an anonymous call alleging that she let her toddler children play around their in-ground pool all day without supervision. </strong>
</p>
<p>But there were two details that would immediately allow any investigator to know the call was false. First, her children were all teenagers. And second, <em>they didn’t even own a pool!</em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Under current practices, the investigator still had boxes to check.</strong> Did she look in the refrigerator to verify there is food in the house? Did she interview each child separately, and away from the parents? Did she check them over for bruises? With a common sense “exit-ramp” provision, the investigator could easily write down “No toddlers, no pool” and close the investigation.</p>
<h4>
<strong>When to Remove a Child from the Home?</strong>
</h4>
<p>And finally, while CAPTA provides funding to states whenever it is deemed necessary to remove children from their home, there is no “standard of removal” in the act. Instead, states must rely on the unrelated Social Security Act, which says children can be removed from any circumstance deemed to be “contrary to the welfare of the child.” But that standard has proven too porous and vague.</p>
<p>
<strong>If through CAPTA the federal government is going to pay for the removal of children from their homes, the same act should provide careful guidelines to make sure children do not suffer the irreversible trauma of removal when it isn’t called for.</strong>
</p>
<p>Last year 83 percent of all child welfare investigations were closed as unfounded or unsubstantiated. That means that, <strong>for every child rescued from abuse or neglect, five innocent families were traumatized needlessly.</strong> Confidential reporting, off-ramp options, and especially a removal standard could help eliminate this unnecessary trauma without stopping the valid work—in fact, they will <em>free more resources for</em> the valid work—of finding and aiding children in actual need.</p>
<h4>
<strong>More Than “Mailing It In”</strong>
</h4>
<p>Under the current pandemic protocols, we aren’t able to muster volunteers and deliver this letter to the congressional leaders in dramatic fashion as we might do in other circumstances. <strong>But that didn’t keep us from getting our concerns where they needed to go.</strong>
</p>
<p>Because our Capitol Hill liaison, Maggie McKneely, has been working on parental rights issues since long before COVID-19, she already had contacts with members of the staff in crucial offices. <strong>So she was able to email our letter directly to the attention of those who needed to see and address our concerns.</strong>
</p>
<p>Yes, technically, we “mailed it in.” But those preexisting relationships have smoothed the way to make sure your concerns for protecting innocent families from trauma will be heard. What’s more, they mean Maggie can continue to monitor the letter’s progress and the discussions that ensue.</p>
<p>So even in the days of lockdown, ParentalRights.org is still making our presence known in Congress as we stand together to protect children and preserve parental rights.</p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p>Michael Ramey<br>Executive Director</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Three weeks ago,<a href="https://parentalrights.org/harvard-magazine/"> I wrote</a> to tell you what Harvard’s Elizabeth Bartholet got wrong about us—<em>and about you</em>—<strong>when she attacked homeschooling in an <a href="https://arizonalawreview.org/homeschooling-parent-rights-absolutism-vs-child-rights-to-education-protection/">
<em>Arizona Law Review</em> article</a> and in <a href="https://harvardmagazine.com/2020/05/right-now-risks-homeschooling">
<em>Harvard Magazine</em>
</a>.</strong>
</p>
<p>Bartholet confused our stance that parental rights are <em>fundamental,</em> which is in keeping with 95 years of Supreme Court precedent, with the extremist notion that they are <em>absolute</em>—<strong>a position we have never held or espoused.</strong>
</p>
<p>This week, <strong>Mike Smith, a member of the board of Parental Rights Foundation and the president of the Home School Legal Defense Association, posted his answer to the same charge over at HSLDA’s site.</strong> Not surprisingly, he makes several of the same points I made a few weeks ago, but he adds a bit more to the discussion, too.</p>
<p>So let me encourage you to <a href="https://hslda.org/post/no-homeschoolers-don-t-assert-an-absolute-right">check out Mike’s article here.</a>
</p>
<p>Thank you for standing with us for fundamental—not absolute—parental rights.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>A <a href="https://harvardmagazine.com/2020/05/right-now-risks-homeschooling">
<em>Harvard Magazine</em> article</a> by Erin O’Donnell called “The Risks of Homeschooling” has fittingly received a lot of attention in the past week, as O’Donnell expounds on the elitist notion of Harvard Professor Elizabeth Bartholet that there should be <strong>“a presumptive ban on the practice [of homeschooling].”</strong>
</p>
<p>Bartholet, the Wasserstein public interest professor of law and faculty director of the Law School’s Child Advocacy Program, understands perfectly well that she is not merely attacking a schooling option but also <strong>the authority and fundamental right of parents to choose that option.</strong>
</p>
<p>In her views as quoted by O’Donnell, Bartholet makes clear her disdain for parental authority and for those who would stand for your fundamental right to decide what is best for your child.</p>
<p>In two instances, Bartholet, intentionally or otherwise, confuses the character of her opponents—including ParentalRights.org—who stand against educational elitism and in favor of family privacy and autonomy.</p>
<h4>
<strong>Total Authority?</strong>
</h4>
<p>In the first instance, <strong>she suggests we would give parents “total authority” over their children.</strong>
</p>
<p>O’Donnell quotes Bartholet saying “the issue is, do we think that parents should have 24/7, essentially authoritarian control over their children from ages zero to 18? I think that’s dangerous.” The quote continues, “I think it’s always dangerous to put powerful people in charge of the powerless, and to give the powerful ones total authority.”</p>
<p>(The<em> irony</em> of that statement is apparently lost on the professor, who proposes setting academic elites in charge of parents and children, giving scholars total authority in the parents’ place, placing “the powerful in charge of the powerless.”)</p>
<p>
<strong>Parents are not given “total authority” over their children.</strong> The Supreme Court has consistently upheld laws that protect children from abuse or neglect at the hands of their parents—or anyone else.</p>
<p>It should be noted, however, that <strong>when it <em>is</em> necessary that someone powerful exercise authority over—and on behalf of—one who is powerless, it is helpful if the powerful <em>know and love</em> the powerless they protect.</strong> “Natural bonds of affection lead parents to act in the best interests of their children,” the Supreme Court has observed. (Parham v. J.R., 442 U.S. 584 (1978), at 602.)</p>
<p>Government overlords and academic elitists have <em>no such</em> compulsion.</p>
<h4>
<strong>Absolute Rights?</strong>
</h4>
<p>In the second instance of misrepresenting us and our allies, Bartholet claims “a central tenet of this [pro-family] lobby is that parents have <em>absolute rights</em> that prevent the state from intervening to try to safeguard the child’s right to education and protection” (emphasis added). Based on its immediate context in the article, this charge is being leveled at Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA) and its allies, which again include ParentalRights.org.</p>
<p>At no point have we put forth the view that parental rights are absolute. In fact, we have often repeated, “No one has a right to abuse a child.”</p>
<p>
<strong>For the reasons explained earlier, parental rights are <em>not</em> absolute</strong>; they do not preclude the state from intervening to rescue children from abuse or neglect.</p>
<p>
<strong>Parental rights are <em>fundamental</em>
</strong>, however, and that requires a high legal standard the state must meet before interference can take place.</p>
<p>
<strong>The distinction is an important one.</strong> If parental rights were absolute, parents could do literally anything they want to their children. Starve them? Beat them? Sell them as slaves? There would be nothing anyone could do to stop them.</p>
<h4>
<strong>Fundamental Rights</strong>
</h4>
<p>
<strong>Rather, fundamental rights—such as parental rights, our freedom of religion, and our freedom of speech—can be limited. . . but only when absolutely necessary to protect the rights of someone else.</strong> The Supreme Court has held that a fundamental right can be infringed only by a law that is narrowly tailored to fulfill a compelling governmental interest by the least restrictive means.</p>
<p>
<strong>Harvard elitists simply don’t like having to meet that standard</strong> (called “strict scrutiny”) before they can impose their own ideology on your family. Strict scrutiny doesn’t give the state any authority to demand a specific kind or content of education that all children must learn.</p>
<p>Going back nearly 100 years, the United States Supreme Court held in <em>Pierce v. Society of Sisters</em>, 268 U.S. 510 (1925), that “[t]he fundamental theory of liberty upon which all governments in this Union repose excludes any general power of the State to standardize its children by forcing them to accept instruction from public teachers only. <strong>The child is not the mere creature of the State; those who nurture him and direct his destiny have the right, coupled with the high duty, to recognize and prepare him for additional obligations”</strong> (at 535).</p>
<p>This is exactly the principle of liberty that Bartholet and her ilk seek to overthrow.</p>
<p>No, we do not hold that parents have “total authority,” nor that their rights are “absolute.”</p>
<p>We just know that <strong>someone is going to have to represent, protect, and make the best decisions for children</strong>, who, by nature of their immaturity, are exceptionally vulnerable. And unlike Bartholet, we recognize that <strong>parents, who know their children best and are driven by love for them, are in the best position to fulfill that vital role.</strong>
</p>
<h4>
<strong>Just the Beginning</strong>
</h4>
<p>This article, as unsettling as it is, is but the opening salvo. <strong>In June, Harvard is hosting an invitation-only conference against a parent’s right to choose how to educate their own children.</strong> And we expect papers, policy proposals, and other assaults on your rights to come out of that conference in the months ahead.</p>
<p>
<strong>We must prepare to meet the onslaught and stand up for the right of loving parents to guide their children to full maturity.</strong> Can we count on you to support our efforts? Could you <a href="http://parentalrights.org/donate">make a donation today to ParentalRights.org</a> so we can be ready to meet this challenge?</p>
<p>Thank you for standing with us today, for the truth that parents, not government elites, know and love their children best.</p>
<p>Together we will protect children by <em>empowering</em> parents, not by <em>robbing</em> them of their natural role.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Michael Ramey<br>Executive Director</p>

<![CDATA[<p>It’s called “the death penalty of the family courts.” The termination of parental rights (TPR) is the most extreme measure that can be inflicted on a family, and it is supposed to be reserved for only those instances where a parent is proven to be abusive or negligent and just won’t (or repeatedly can’t) change.</p>
<p>Yet, thanks to a restrictive provision of the Adoption and Safe Families Act, or ASFA, <strong>the threat of termination is looming against parents who are getting their lives in order.</strong>
</p>
<p>The aim of ASFA when it was adopted in 1997 was to prevent children from languishing in foster care or group homes, while parents who were unwilling to change bounced from treatment to treatment and program to program. So it includes a time-limit provision: <strong>if a child has spent at least 15 of the last 22 months in state custody, a TPR can be filed based on that fact alone.</strong>
</p>
<p>The idea was to take children who bounced in and out of foster care in time with their parents’ relapses and free them to be adopted into a stable and permanent home. It was a good and noble idea.</p>
<p>
<strong>But in the days of COVID-19, that’s not all the “15 of 22” provision applies to. </strong>
</p>
<p>In these days of quarantines and other extreme measures<strong>, even parents who have gotten their acts together are not getting their families back.</strong> (And some families who should never have been separated in the first place are facing the same problem!)</p>
<p>The challenges are serious enough that Jerry Milner and David Kelly, both with the Children’s Bureau at the US Department of Health and Human Services, wrote <a href="https://chronicleofsocialchange.org/child-welfare-2/family-is-a-compelling-reason/42119">an article last week</a> to highlight and correct them.</p>
<p>With the rise of the novel coronavirus, Milner and Kelly warn<strong>, some families will be separated longer as services and scheduled visits are suspended.</strong> In some cases, the suspension will be warranted due to the presence of the virus in either the birth home or the foster home setting. But in many other cases, no such threat will be known to exist—yet services will be suspended anyway.</p>
<p>
<strong>“We cannot allow our shortcomings to be held against families,” they warn.</strong>
</p>
<p>These shortcomings make the 15/22 provision of ASFA especially concerning. In many cases, families were on track to be reunited this spring. But with quarantines and lockdowns, and with many courthouses closed until further notice, some of those cases will cross the 15/22 guideline for no other reason than the virus.</p>
<p>In light of this, Milner and Kelly warn, “We must be mindful of what is fair and just for parents in these situations. The law provides a tool for circumstances like these, compelling reasons not to file to terminate parental rights. The agency can demonstrate that compelling reasons exist not to file to terminate parental rights, even when the 15/22 month mark has been reached . . .”</p>
<p>
<strong>In short, if the family was progressing fine, and the deadline hit only due to the virus, that is compelling reason <em>not</em> to terminate those rights.</strong>
</p>
<p>We couldn’t agree more.</p>
<p>In fact, we are talking with coalition partners and looking for ways to bring a bill to Congress that would suspend the 15/22 rule for as long as lockdowns exist. It would have to be nuanced, because there also exist cases where children are languishing and need a “forever home.”</p>
<p>We want to protect families from unnecessary separation and trauma, while still taking care of the children who need help.</p>
<p>
<strong>But by no means should a family lose one another forever simply because their court date was pushed back, and their visitation suspended, over this virus outbreak.</strong>
</p>
<p>It’s a problem that has become so prominent in California that several organizations there have <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdCobSTU2O59EOPRufO-k7ofKJsOU3c3LgnJoaalgSq82htng/viewform">
<strong>launched a petition</strong>
</a>
<strong> urging that visitations with noncustodial parents be reinstated.</strong> That’s because it appears that, in their state, <em>all forms of supervised visitation have been suspended</em>.</p>
<p>
<strong>“Every day that we do not maintain connections between children in care and their parents and siblings is a source of trauma,” Milner and Kelly wrote.</strong> States and counties across the country (including California) need to take creative steps to keep these families in touch with one another.</p>
<p>In the new language of our times, family—even imperfect family—is “essential.” So we must do all we can to protect it.</p>
<p>Thank you for standing with ParentalRights.org as we take up the new challenges to parental rights that are spawned in our present reality. Together we can stand tall and weather the storm with our families intact!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Several weeks ago I was going to speak at an Indiana home school conference.</p>
<p>Due to the coronavirus, the conference didn’t happen, but since I couldn’t share this with the attendees in person, I want to take this opportunity to share with you <strong>a few of the reasons why I fight for parental rights, and what that fight looks like for all of us today. &amp;nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>This country is facing the question of our age: whether children are better served when fit parents raise, nurture, and educate them. </strong>We at ParentalRights.org firmly believe that the answer is yes, they are.</p>
<p>Sadly, we’ve all seen how this basic understanding is being slowly eroded.</p>
<p>
<strong>It’s a long-standing truth, but it is challenged every day.</strong> That’s why we’re both fighting bills that threaten your rights and working on positive legislation to protect American families on the state, national, and international levels.</p>
<p>Our goal is that parental rights will be protected as we continue to move forward with the Parental Rights Amendment, the long-term project that would help protect Americans against unnecessary intrusion and tragedy.</p>
<p>
<strong>We think that the common sense reforms I mention below, and others, will result in less trauma to children </strong>and will free up child welfare workers to focus where they are really needed.</p>
<p>We believe that children are best served when fit parents have great liberty to raise, nurture, and educate them. But <strong>we have a lot of work to do, and I welcome your support.</strong>
</p>

<h4 style="text-align: center;">Complete Transcript</h4>
<p>Do you believe that children are better served when fit parents have great liberty to raise, nurture, and educate them? Or do think children are better off when the judgments of loving parents are influenced, modified, and sometimes replaced by state-appointed experts, who believe they are acting in the best interests of your child?</p>
<p>That is the question of our age, as more and more of the zone traditionally left to the decision-making of fit parents is intruded upon by an ever-growing state mechanism that thinks it knows best and by cultural changes that increasingly put pressure on the traditional understanding of the role of parents in the lives of their children.</p>
<p>I’m Jim Mason, Vice President of Home School Legal Defense Association and President of Parentalrights.org. And I answer this question—we answer this question—that we believe that children thrive best when loving parents are free to make decisions in the best interests of their children without undue interference from the state. We agree with the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which said in one of our early cases:</p>
<p>“The government’s interest in the welfare of children embraces not only protecting children from physical abuse, but also protecting <strong>
<em>
<u>children’s</u>
</em>
</strong> interest in the privacy and dignity of their homes and in the lawfully exercised authority of their parents.”</p>
<p>Notice that the Court said that <em>children</em> have an interest in the authority of their parents<em> that the state should protect</em>.</p>
<p>Because we perceived that this traditional understanding has been slowly eroding over time we have been working towards amending the US Constitution to include a parental rights amendment, to put the traditionally understood fundamental right into the text of the Constitution in black and white.</p>
<p>
<strong>Amending the US Constitution is a <em>marathon</em> broken into two-year sprints. </strong>Each new Congress we must find a sponsor in the House and the Senate; the resolution must be supported by 2/3 of both houses during that single two year Congress; then ratified by 3/4 of the state legislatures, in a time usually included in the Congressional resolution, often 7 years.</p>
<p>Constitutional amendments are hard to pass. The first effort to pass an Equal Rights Amendment began in 1921. It finally passed Congress in 1972, a month before President Nixon’s friends broke into the Watergate. Then it fell short of ratification in the states—maybe. The original resolution put a 7 year deadline on ratification. That deadline was adopted by 2/3 of each house. As the deadline approached, a simple majority in each house passed a resolution to extend the deadline an additional three years. Those additional three years elapsed without reaching the magic number of state ratifications.</p>
<p>But the ERA is back in the news as the newly minted Virginia General Assembly earlier this year became the 38th state to vote to ratify it, which would be three-fourths of states if Virginia’s vote is valid—and other moving parts are also valid.</p>
<p>But this vote was well after both the first and the putative second deadline have passed. What’s more, in the ensuing years, 5 states that at first ratified the ERA have rescinded their ratification—if they legally can. Proponents of the ERA say that once a state has ratified the amendment it can’t change its mind, and that the deadlines are not exactly deadlines—they’re more of what you’d call “guidelines” than actual rules, as Captain Barbossa might say. Almost a hundred years in the making and much Con-law mayhem is about to ensue, in the courts, in state legislatures, and in talking head land.</p>
<p>Our founder Mike Farris’s original idea for forming Parentalrights.org in 2006 was to pass a parental rights amendment quickly, before society had moved too far away from a traditional understanding of the role of parents in the lives of children, and to prevent further erosion and growing state intrusions between parents and children.</p>
<p>There was a template for this. Although the idea of lowering the voting age from 21 to 18 had been around since 1941, the Vietnam War became a catalyst. After the Supreme Court held in 1970 that a federal statute lowering the voting age was unconstitutional as applied to state elections, President Nixon asked Congress to amend the US Constitution. Congress sent the 26th Amendment to the states on March 23, 1971 and it was ratified by the states on July 1, 1971.</p>
<p>But that didn’t happen with the parental rights amendment, so <strong>we are in it for the long haul, confident that as the need becomes clear to more and more people it will gain traction in Congress</strong>. Remember, this is a marathon broken into two-year sprints. Once upon a time I completed the Portland marathon—I won’t say I <em>ran</em> the Portland marathon—but I did complete it. I can attest that completing a marathon is not something most people decide to do one day then go out and do the next day. It requires daily discipline over a long period of time. I ran over a thousand miles the year I did the marathon, each week extending my long run by about ten percent over the previous week, until my weekly long run became 17 miles then 18 miles and so on.</p>
<p>The supporters of the ERA have been at it for a hundred years and they haven’t given up—and neither will we.</p>
<p>But in<strong> the</strong> <strong>meantime there is other important and useful work that we are doing and that we need your support in doing.</strong>
</p>
<p>Criminal justice reform has been much in the news lately. I’m here to talk to you about another kind of related reform that is much needed but is not talked about very much. <strong>This country’s child protective services are in great need of reform because the way they operate today needlessly harms many children in pursuit of the noble goal of protecting children.</strong>
</p>
<p>So I’m here today to explain why we at Parentalrights.org and Parental Rights Foundation have taken up the issue of reforming the way child welfare investigations are conducted. <strong>With a few commonsense reforms we could reduce needless harm to millions of children and their parents each year while allowing child-welfare investigators to devote their limited resources more efficiently to the children who are truly in need.</strong>
</p>
<p>I wear two hats—one, as Vice President of Home School Legal Defense Association, which is a national nonprofit organization whose mission is to protect the fundamental constitutional right of parents to direct the education of their children. With over 80,000 member families in fifty states, HSLDA is the world’s largest homeschool advocacy organization.</p>
<p>Parentalrights.org and the Parental Rights Foundation were born out of the experience HSLDA gained helping homeschooling families, realizing that other children and parents also need help. In the early days of the modern homeschooling movement, we discovered that <strong>child-welfare investigators routinely avoid interacting with parents at the beginning of an investigation by going to the child’s school or pre-school to interview and physically examine the child without parental knowledge or consent.</strong> But because homeschooled children are at home when they are at school, child-welfare investigators could not routinely avoid parents.</p>
<p>This led to many distressing encounters at the front door of homeschooling family’s homes, often simply because they homeschooled at a time when it was not as accepted as it is today. Often the allegations would be something like this, “There’s a really religious family on my street and the kids are always at home during school hours.”</p>
<p>It was HSLDA’s position then, as it is now, that child-welfare investigators have a difficult and often thankless job in protecting children from abuse and neglect, <strong>but the government also has an important interest, as I mentioned earlier, in protecting the interests of children in the privacy and dignity of their homes</strong> <strong>and in the lawfully-exercised authority of their parents</strong>—especially while investigating allegations of abuse or neglect.</p>
<p>From its founding in 1983, HSLDA has assisted thousands of families in protecting those interests during these encounters, often commenced in response to anonymous or malicious hotline tips that later prove to be unfounded. HSLDA was lead counsel in <em>Calabretta v. Floyd</em>, in which the Ninth Circuit case I quoted from earlier, held that the nonconsensual entry into the home and subsequent strip search of the children violated the Fourth Amendment rights of that homeschooling family.</p>
<p>In North Carolina and Pennsylvania, we defended families in investigations that led to statewide appellate court decisions that reinforced that child-welfare investigations are subject to the Fourth Amendment, which many CPS investigators disagree with or ignore in the name of “the children.”</p>
<p>HSLDA is currently representing a homeschooling mother in Kentucky. The investigator was responding to a non-emergency report that the mom had left her children in the car for less than ten minutes the day before while she ran into Cobbler’s Café to buy the kids some muffins on the way to karate practice. The children were never in danger, no harm came to them, and in any event, the allegation had nothing to do with the condition of the home or physical abuse that would justify looking for signs of physical injury. And it was not illegal in Kentucky for parents to leave their children unattended in a safe and responsible manner (although this is one of those cultural shifts that has recently occurred. It is far more common today for members of the public to second-guess the decisions parents make and then make a hotline call, apparently oblivious to what they will be unleashing on an innocent family).</p>
<p>The Kentucky child-welfare investigator bullied her way into the home with an armed police officer, without a warrant or consent, by threatening to take the kids into foster care. The investigator then strip searched all six kids, euphemistically calling it a “body check.” <strong>After the investigation was closed as unfounded, the investigator referred to it as “an oopsie-daisy.” </strong>
</p>
<p>To vindicate the family and hopefully set a precedent that will change things for the better for all families, we sued the investigator—which we like to think of as <em>her</em> oopsie-daisy. We are waiting for the judge to rule on the CPS investigator’s motion to throw the case out of court.</p>
<p>At her deposition the investigator said, “This is what I always do.” And her testimony is consistent with our experience all over the country.</p>
<p>Because homeschooling depends on the recognition of the right of all parents to direct the education of their children, <strong>the abuses we discovered on behalf of homeschoolers led us to start the sister organization to advocate for all parents. </strong>
</p>
<p>Parental Rights Foundation is concerned about the erosion of the legal protection of parents to raise, nurture, and educate their children without undue state interference, and about the unfortunate, unintended consequences to innocent children caused by the routine overreach of the child-welfare system. <strong>We seek to protect children by educating those in government and the public about the need to roll back some of the intrusive state mechanisms that have worked to harm more children than they help.&amp;nbsp; </strong>
</p>
<p>In her seminal article on the effect of child-welfare investigations, Storming the Castle to Save the Children: The Ironic Costs of a Child Welfare Exception to the Fourth Amendment, (2005), Duke University law professor, Doriane Coleman, said, “The investigations undermine the fundamental values of privacy, dignity, personal security, and mobility that are protected by the Fourth Amendment.”</p>
<p>Often the only recourse for families wrongly treated is to sue for federal civil rights violations. But the doctrine of qualified immunity shields many state actors from ever being held responsible. That doctrine is designed to protect law enforcement and others from being held liable for money damages when they must make split-second decisions in the field, often life and death decisions. But the doctrine has been expanded by the courts so far that it has become increasingly difficult to establish when public officials violate a family’s constitutional rights.</p>
<p>Much research shows that the state, in its effort to investigate child abuse and neglect, can often cause more harm than good. As Professor Coleman wrote, “The majority of intrusions on family privacy do not directly benefit the children involved, and in many instances actually cause them demonstrable harm.” More recently, Professor Teri Dobbins Baxter wrote, “Research has shown that <strong>investigations, particularly those that are unnecessarily intrusive or that separate children from their caregivers, can be traumatic and psychologically harmful to the children as well as damaging to the family as a whole.” </strong>
</p>
<p>Another law professor wrote that, “<strong>children, of course, have a strong interest in being free from abuse. But they also have a strong interest in being free from intrusive, traumatic questioning by strangers.” </strong>
</p>
<p>Millions of child-welfare investigations are conducted every year, and the vast majority of these investigations, roughly 80 percent, end with a finding that the children were not victims.</p>
<p>The numbers are staggering. In 2002, according to HHS reports, there were approximately 1.8 million child-welfare investigations nationwide. Only twenty-eight percent of the children “were ultimately found to be victims of abuse or neglect.” Coleman, supra at 417. More recent numbers are even more sobering. According to HHS statistics from 2016, 4 million children, nearly double the 2002 numbers, were investigated, and fewer than 20% were actual victims.</p>
<p>
<strong>In other words, for every family investigated and found to be neglectful or abusive, four other families are disrupted by an investigation that finds no victim. </strong>
</p>
<p>And many of those in the 20% who were determined to be neglectful never get a day in court—they are instead placed on a central child abuse registry, where their name comes up in background checks for jobs like teaching, for security clearances, for adoption, for volunteering to teach Sunday school or coach rec-league soccer. In most states, parents are put on the central register based on the judgment of a local child-welfare office and must go through an administrative appeal to protest that determination and be removed from the registry.</p>
<p>“Perhaps even more of these investigations should close without findings of abuse or neglect. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has described administrative findings of abuse or neglect as “at best imperfect,” noting that <strong>three-quarters of administrative challenges succeed in reversing such findings.</strong>” Gupta-Kagan, supra at 362.</p>
<p>My office has handled 8 administrative appeals in the last two years, mostly involving paperwork disputes in the homeschool setting—All 8 were successful in getting the parent off the central registry.</p>
<p>Reforms we would like to see:</p>
<h4>First: Adopt into state-law that Fourth Amendment protections—and state constitutional equivalents—apply to child-welfare investigations.</h4>
<p>Why? <strong>Child Welfare Investigators and supporting law enforcement officers incorrectly believe that the Fourth Amendment does not apply to child-welfare investigations, causing much disruption and harm to innocent families in their own homes</strong>—the place the Supreme Court says is most protected and where children need to feel the most safe and secure.</p>
<h4>Second: Do not investigate based on uncorroborated anonymous reports—instead require reporters to leave verifiable contact information that will remain confidential unless later determined to be knowingly false or malicious. This should significantly reduce the number of false reports.</h4>
<p>Why? Anonymous reports are notoriously unreliable and can be easily weaponized. They are often exploited during divorce and child custody disputes.</p>
<p>A judge of my acquaintance recently had his life turned upside down when a criminal defendant made an anonymous report about his son. The report was scurrilous and implausible on its face. Nevertheless, the day after the judge made an unfavorable ruling against the defendant, his son was pulled out of class at school, questioned by a CPS investigator without his parents knowledge or consent. The boy feared that something bad had happened to his parents or that he must have done something wrong. <strong>The first time his parents knew anything about it was when the school called <em>and asked them</em> to pick the boy up because he was so traumatized</strong>—that’s the judge’s word—that he could not continue with the school day. The investigator then came to the judge’s home and demanded to see where the boy slept and that there was food in the refrigerator, which is what they almost always want to do.</p>
<p>Our HSLDA attorneys help people in these circumstances all the time. Anonymous reports must go!</p>
<h4>Third: Make it clear that investigators may terminate an investigation immediately once they determine the report is false.</h4>
<p>An after-hours call I handled a few years ago aptly illustrates the point. A homeschool mom in Virginia said a CPS investigator was at her door demanding to come in and interview her children based on a report that she frequently left her toddlers unattended by the pool in the back yard.</p>
<p>“But Mr. Mason,” she said, “There’s two things wrong with this. First, my children are all teenagers.”</p>
<p>“What’s the second thing?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Well,” she said more calmly than I would have, “I don’t have a swimming pool.”</p>
<p>Forgetting momentarily that I was in CPS investigator-land, <strong>I for a moment thought that common sense would prevail.</strong> I told our member to take the investigator to the backyard and show him that there was no swimming pool. Then I spoke to him:</p>
<p>“As I am sure you will agree,” I began, certain that my unassailable logic and commonsense would prevail, “the anonymous report is false. There is no swimming pool to leave <em>anyone</em> unattended beside, even if she had toddlers, which she doesn’t.”</p>
<p>As if speaking to a young child, the investigator explained, “It doesn’t really matter that there is no pool. I have started an investigation and I cannot leave until I complete it. I still need to look inside the home and interview the children privately.’</p>
<p>It then became a whole thing. <strong>Imagine how much more sense it would make for the investigator to be freed up to acknowledge that the tip was false and then go about his business—HELPING children who were really in need</strong>. Our attorneys handle this kind of call regularly.</p>
<h4>Fourth: Require notice and opportunity to be heard in an administrative hearing BEFORE being placed on the central register rather than having to fight to get taken off the register.</h4>
<p>Following the notorious case of Penn State Coach Jerry Sandusky, Pennsylvania reformed its child-welfare laws in the opposite direction. A few years later a state auditor found that this led to worse rather than better results. <strong>More needless investigations led to worker burnout, caused needless distress to more children and parents, and caused actual needy children to fall through the cracks. </strong>
</p>
<p>We think that the common sense reforms I mentioned, and others, consistent with constitutional rights, will result in less harm to many children and will free up child-welfare workers to focus where they are really needed.</p>
<p>We’re working with a bipartisan coalition to fashion model state legislation to achieve these goals. One of the model bills we worked on together has been introduced in Colorado.</p>
<p>Another thing we’re watching very closely is the re-emergence of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC).</p>
<p>Some bad ideas just refuse to die. After lying dormant for several years, the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child has once again entered the spotlight via a newly introduced resolution in the US House of Representatives.</p>
<p>On November 20, 1989, the CRC was proposed. By September of the next year, 20 countries had signed it, the threshold needed to bring the treaty into force. Since then, 196 other nations have also signed it.</p>
<p>In 1995, Secretary of State Madeline Albright signed the treaty on behalf of the US, but it was never ratified by the Senate. <strong>As of 2020, the US remains the sole country to not have ratified the CRC.</strong>
</p>
<p>And we are working to keep it that way. We know that <strong>children do best when parents are free to make the most beneficial choice for their kids.</strong> <strong>Parents don’t need an unelected bureaucrat in a faraway land to tell them what’s best for their child.</strong> Yet empowering officials to overrule parents is exactly what the CRC does.</p>
<p>One of the main tenets advanced by the CRC is that the government should make decisions based on the “best interest of the child” in all cases. In the United States, this principle has traditionally been used only in cases where parents have been determined to be unfit, thus allowing judges to make major decisions on behalf of children.</p>
<p>But under this international treaty, the application of “best interests” could be broadened to include cases involving fit parents. Under the CRC, this benign-sounding language could be used by courts and child-welfare agencies to usurp the rights of parents, to the detriment of their children. It would grant authorities in the US the power to determine if a parent’s decision regarding education or religion is in the child’s best interest or not.</p>
<p>According to international law expert Geraldine Van Bueren, the leading scholar on the CRC, “‘best interests’ provides decision and policy makers with the authority to substitute their own decisions for either the child’s or the parents, providing it is based on considerations of the best interests of the child. Thus, the convention challenges the concept that family life is always in the best interests of children and that parents are always capable of deciding what is best for children.”</p>
<p>
<strong>Fit parents should always have the right to make fundamental decisions for their children, particularly regarding education and religion. But the CRC would undermine that right.</strong>
</p>
<p>In the early years of the fight against the CRC, HSLDA opposed it out of concern that it could be used to restrict homeschooling.</p>
<p>We know now those concerns were well-founded. A number of nations, including&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.hslda.org/content/docs/news/200906161.asp">England</a>,&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.hslda.org/content/hs/international/UnitedKingdom/201405200.asp">Northern Ireland</a>, and&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.hslda.org/content/hs/international/sweden/200909160.asp">Sweden</a>, have proposed or imposed regulations that curb the freedom to homeschool, all in the name of the CRC. Other countries, such as&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.hslda.org/content/hs/international/201007070.asp">Botswana</a>, have handed down negative court rulings or harassed homeschool families under the CRC’s authority.</p>
<p>To some, the fact that the US has still not ratified the treaty is appalling and unacceptable. Representative Ilhan Omar stated in her press release regarding the resolution that “protecting the rights of children is fundamental, and we should be a world leader on this issue, which we can’t be unless we’re a state party to the convention.”</p>
<p>But ratifying the CRC in the US would have zero impact on children in other parts of the world. Instead, it would override many existing American laws on children, dismantling the protections families enjoy today. <strong>Currently, family and education laws are created by the states; ratification of the CRC would transfer jurisdiction of those laws to the US Congress. Congress, in turn, would have to follow the mandates of the CRC.</strong>
</p>
<p>As a House resolution that merely calls on the Senate to ratify the treaty, which ain’t gonna happen this year, HR 854 would substantively do very little. However,<strong> the CRC is an ever-present threat. Because the US has signed the treaty, the next step, Senate ratification, can happen at any time—</strong>it’s simply a matter of changing the Senate into one that supports the treaty by 2/3 majority.</p>
<p>That’s why, <strong>if members of Congress want to once again extoll the virtues of the CRC, we will remind them why ratification should never take place.</strong> Not if they truly care about the well-being of American children.</p>
<p>While passing an amendment to the US Constitution is not likely to happen quickly, we need nevertheless to work to preserve the traditional role parents play in the lives of their children<strong>. We see this being challenged every day in a host of ways. That’s why we’re working on model legislation, in alliance with a broad coalition, and why we continue to monitor Congress and the UN.</strong>
</p>
<p>I began by asking if you believe that children are better served when fit parents have great liberty to raise, nurture, and educate them. We have a lot of work to do and I welcome your support. Please go to parentalrights.org or parental rights foundation.org to learn more.</p>
<p>Thank you also to my hosts, Indiana Association of Home Education and Homeschoolers of Maine for allowing me to speak here today. They are the backbone of homeschool freedom, and they know that homeschool freedom depends on the traditionally understood, fundamental right of parents to raise, nurture and educate their children. So please support them as much as you can, especially through these difficult times.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>James Mason<br>
President</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Do you believe that children are better served when fit parents have the liberty to raise, nurture, and educate them? Or do think children are better off when the decisions of loving parents are influenced, modified, and sometimes <em>replaced</em> by the opinions of state-appointed experts, who believe they are acting in the best interests of your child?</p>
<p>That is the question of our age, as <strong>more and more of the zones traditionally left to fit parents are intruded upon by an ever-growing state mechanism</strong> that thinks it knows best.</p>
<p>One bold example of this intrusion can be seen in <strong>an upcoming Harvard event that looks to challenge the role of parents</strong> by questioning their right and ability to educate their children.</p>
<p>The event is called <strong>“The Homeschooling Summit: Problems, Politics, and Prospects for Reform.”</strong>
</p>
<p>You and I know that the liberty to homeschool stands on the right of parents to direct the education of their children.  Yet <strong>the speakers for this summit make arguments for regulating homeschooling out of necessity,</strong> which would amount to invading the zone of parental decision-making that I mentioned above.</p>
<p>One of this summit’s co-organizers is <strong>James Dwyer</strong>, a law professor at the College of William &amp; Mary. He is the professor <a href="https://parentalrights.org/dwyer/">famous for claiming</a> that <strong>“the reason parent-child relationships exist is because the State confers legal parenthood . . .”</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Dwyer went even further</strong> in his 1994 law review article “Parents’ Religion and Children’s Welfare: Debunking the Doctrine of Parents’ Rights” (82 Calif. L. Rev. 1371), arguing that “the claim that parents should have child-rearing rights—rather than simply being permitted to perform parental duties and to make certain decisions on a child’s behalf in accordance with the child’s rights—<strong>is inconsistent with principles deeply embedded in our law and morality.”</strong>
</p>
<p>This is just an example of how the co-organizers of this event disregard the rights and importance of parents.</p>
<p>The other co-organizer, Harvard Law School professor <strong>Elizabeth Bartholet</strong>, is working on a draft law review article called <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3391331">“Homeschooling: Parent Rights Absolutism vs. Child Rights to Education &amp; Protection,”  </a>in which <strong>she is critical of those of us (<em>some called out by name</em>) who hold the traditional view that children are best protected when parents are presumed to be acting in their child’s best interest.</strong>
</p>
<p>That view is hardly “absolutist.” But it is both traditional and, according to what the Supreme Court has said for decades, the correct legal view. Yet, <strong>even though both the Supreme Court and tradition are on our side, there are still those who want to take these basic rights away from parents.</strong>
</p>
<p>Elitist opinions like those held by Professors Dwyer and Bartholet are why ParentalRights.org exist, and why we have worked to amend the US Constitution to include the right of parents to raise, nurture, and educate their children.</p>
<p>
<strong>We will be following the Harvard event with interest.</strong> In the face of these arguments against the natural bonds of families, we stand for the rights of parents to direct the upbringing and education of their children.</p>
<p>But we cannot do this without your support. Would you be willing to <a href="http://parentalrights.org/donate">partner with us today</a> as we continue to spread awareness and affect change in support of parents’ rights?</p>
<p>
<strong>People like Professors Dwyer and Bartholet will continue to push against our work – and the work of like-minded organizations.</strong> But the generous support of partners like you enables us to<strong> keep responding to threats, passing good legislation, and fighting for families across America.</strong>

<![CDATA[<p>We have two important announcements for Pennsylvania residents.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">
<strong>
<u>Rally Cancelled:</u>
</strong>
</h4>
<p>We are sad to officially announce that t<strong>he May 25 Pennsylvania “Parents Know Best Rally” has been cancelled.</strong> Pennsylvania has shut down any events at the capitol in the wake of COVID-19.</p>
<p>We hope to reschedule for the future, so keep an eye out for that email.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">
<strong>
<u>Action Item: </u>
</strong>
</h4>
<p>While our rally can’t happen, <strong>we need you to take immediate action against <a href="https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billInfo/billInfo.cfm?sYear=2019&amp;sInd=0&amp;body=S&amp;type=B&amp;bn=0633">PA Senate Bill 633</a>,</strong> the Public Health Emergency Act—sponsored by Senator Jay Costa (D-PA)—which would<em> take away civil liberties</em> during times of uncertainty by granting<em> more power to the state government</em>.</p>
<p>By calling for the closing of schools and nonessential businesses, Gov. Wolf has already made S.B. 633 unnecessary. More importantly, however, S.B. 633 is dangerous because <strong>its limits are not clearly defined</strong>, and <strong>it does not protect the individual rights of citizens.</strong>
</p>
<p>Even more concerning, there is no guarantee that the new powers granted to the state would end once the health emergency in question (in this case, COVID-19) was over.</p>
<p>In order to prevent this bill from passing the PA House (it has already passed in the Senate), <strong>we need you contact your representatives now and urge them to vote “no” on S.B. 633. </strong>
</p>
<p>Because Gov. Wolf’s Emergency Declaration prohibits people from going to the capitol to lobby in person, <strong>you’ll have to use phone calls, faxes, emails, and social media to influence your legislators.</strong>
</p>
<p>To fight this bill, we are working closely with our ally, the Pennsylvania Coalition for Informed Consent; they have an excellent fact sheet on their website that goes into the details of why S.B. 633 is so dangerous (you can follow the link <a href="https://informedconsentpa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/2020_3_14_Emegency-Powers_633W_3.pdf">here</a>).</p>
<p>We need you to join us in the fight to stop S.B. 633 and its unnecessary government overreach.</p>
<p>
<strong>Together we can stop the passage of S.B. 633.</strong>
</p>
<p>Stay safe and healthy,</p>
<p>Cory Gibbons,<br>
Contact Coordinator</p>

<![CDATA[<p>
<strong>It really isn’t the end of the world.</strong> But the pandemic status of COVID-19 has certainly brought about some significant changes for each of us in our daily lives.</p>
<p>For millions, the biggest change is that the kids are home. Schools are shut down for the next several weeks, with some sources hinting that many schools may stay closed until the other side of summer break. (Virginia’s governor just confirmed this in our state while this article was in editing.)</p>
<p>For others, the biggest change may be telecommuting. Rather than suits and ties, endless meetings, and a cubicle, now it’s pajamas, conference calls, and a laptop or home computer.</p>
<p>There is no denying that life has slowed down, and<strong> family has once again become the center of everything.</strong>
</p>
<p>This, at least, is a good thing.</p>
<p>
<strong>We firmly believe that the relationships we have with our family are foundational to who we are as human beings and members of society.</strong> Cherish this unexpected time you have with your children.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">
<strong>Fresh Excuse for False Reports</strong>
</h4>
<p>
<strong>But we must also remain vigilant and wise.</strong>
</p>
<p>At ParentalRights.org, we have heard accounts of <strong>families being reported to CPS for taking their family out in public</strong> during these days of social distancing.</p>
<p>As if busybodies needed one more excuse to call an anonymous child abuse hotline.</p>
<p>These accounts aren’t common, and we don’t expect it to spread, but we are aware of it and thought you should know, too. Apparently, <strong>even in this time of goodwill, there are still people out there ready to make an unnecessary report of child abuse against good and reasonable parents.</strong>
</p>
<p>Now is the perfect time for getting some more fresh air and sunshine with your family, but make sure you do it wisely.</p>
<p>Go to a nature path or on a leisurely walk around the block, but <strong>don’t go out in a crowded park or other public place.</strong> And, as always, you can wave to neighbors, just don’t get too close to them.</p>
<p>Enjoy this opportunity you have as a family to just be together.</p>
<p>But we ask that you also <strong>remember those who are not so fortunate, whose families have been divided by government intrusion, most of them without a solid reason.</strong>
</p>
<p>Those families are having it even harder right now, as their already-limited visitations are cut due to quarantines. So please keep them in your thoughts and prayers.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">
<strong>Stay Connected</strong>
</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, we as the ParentalRights.org family need to stay in touch.</p>
<p>Rallies and lobby events have been cancelled. Lobbyists aren’t heading up to Capitol Hill. Even our little office in Virginia is generally empty, as our team works remotely from our individual homes. (We go in every few days for the mail and other necessary on-site duties.)</p>
<p>But <strong>parental rights abuses,</strong> like the one I mentioned earlier in this letter, <strong>are still taking place.</strong> We won’t see them in the one-track news right now. But <strong>if you hear of them, you can let us know.</strong>
</p>
<p>On a discussion board I frequent, someone recently wrote, <strong>“We aren’t social distancing. We’re just physically distancing. Socially, we’re as connected as ever.”</strong> That’s our hope as a parental rights community, too.</p>
<p>Please, check out <a href="https://www.facebook.com/parentalrights.org/">our Facebook page,</a> or even the Facebook page for your state. (We have about 20 state-specific parental rights pages.) Drop us a note, and certainly alert us to any abuses you’re seeing. <strong>We’d really love it if you would stop by daily and just say “Hi!”</strong>
</p>
<p>You are our community.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">
<strong>Uncertain Brings Opportunity</strong>
</h4>
<p>These are uncertain days for all of us, but “uncertainty” doesn’t have to mean “fear.”</p>
<p>This break from the routine, as unsettling as it may feel, contains a whole world of possibilities.</p>
<p>We may find opportunities we’ve never had before to look out for our neighbors, to encourage other families, and to enjoy having our children close by. And we can learn to connect in new ways.</p>
<p>
<strong>Today, much more than usual, our family defines our whole life.</strong> And I’m good with that; I believe in my family.</p>
<p>
<strong>We at ParentalRights.org believe in your family, too.</strong>
</p>
<p>So, thank you for standing with us. Please keep in touch!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>

<![CDATA[<p>Just when we think they won’t get any more brazen, they do.</p>
<p>Not long ago, the system’s violations of parental rights were kept to the shadows. Child Protective Services (CPS) targeted minorities and the poor because these were least able to defend themselves, and more likely to be dismissed by the general population.</p>
<p>But the once-secretive system has since faced  high-profile cases, like Maryanne Godboldo’s SWAT team standoff and the Pelletier family’s fight to rescue their  daughter, Justina, from the trauma inflicted by Boston Children’s Hospital. And instead of being ashamed, the System has just gotten bolder.</p>
<p>
<strong>Now the System has successfully stacked itself so high against families that even insiders are no longer immune.</strong>
</p>
<p>Earlier this year we heard from a court officer who found out first-hand how easy it can be for someone to make an anonymous false accusation against him through a child abuse hotline. And he learned that CPS won’t just drop it, even when they have far more evidence that the report was intentionally false than they do that abuse has ever taken place. <strong>And now doctors are being accused of child abuse by the very hospitals they work for.</strong>
</p>
<p>You may have already heard the story of Wisconsin doctors John Cox and his wife, Sadie Dobrozsi. Their nightmare was featured in <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/er-doctor-was-charged-abusing-his-baby-15-medical-experts-n1123756">two full-length</a> <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/doctors-wisconsin-hospital-call-changes-amid-backlash-over-child-abuse-n1131151?fbclid=IwAR1TY8v1nbS2aGq4PfyTdoTtDn-zHkye-epMJqkDuw52Z6jaK1KHX1VXr2U">articles</a> on NBC News’ website last month.</p>
<p>John and Sadie were living a dream, getting to know and love the precious baby girl they were in the process of adopting. One morning John was resting with their daughter on his chest.</p>
<p>Suddenly, he awoke in a panic to her crying. He had dozed off, and in his sleep his body had shifted so that he was now partially lying on the little girl.</p>
<p>In tears, John called his wife and the two examined the child together. Because they suspected she may have a broken collar bone, they agreed <strong>John should do as any parent would, doctor or not: take her in to the emergency room (which happened to be in the hospital where they both worked).</strong>
</p>
<p>That is where their real nightmare began.</p>
<p>The attending physician, a friend of John and Sadie, knew this injury was not a result of abuse. But rather than show favoritism to his colleagues, he treated them as he would anyone else, alerting the child abuse pediatrics team to the injury. After all,<strong> since there was no abuse, it wouldn’t hurt anything to let the team confirm that, too.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>But that is apparently not what the child abuse pediatrics team does.</strong>
</p>
<p>Instead, they declared that the broken collar bone was clearly non-accidental, and they diagnosed the baby with “widespread contusions”—bruises all over her body.</p>
<p>The team called CPS, who accused John of abuse and whisked the couple’s baby away. That was nine months ago, and they haven’t gotten to see her since.</p>
<p>But that’s <em>not the end</em> of the injustice.</p>
<p>Two child abuse pediatricians testified in court that the broken collar bone and the widespread bruises were certain signs of abuse. It was their “medical diagnosis.” Nothing else could possibly have created these symptoms, and a child abuse specialist would know. <strong>Except that they were wrong.</strong>
</p>
<p>No fewer than seven dermatologists examined the baby after she was brought in, and all seven agreed: what had been diagnoses as bruises were almost all birthmarks. At most there were three small bruises on her body, and these could have been from basic, even careful, handling if the child suffered from a blood condition that leads to easy bruising.</p>
<p>Four hematologists and the mother, herself a pediatric hematologist-oncologist, knew from the test results that such a condition was likely indicated. But one of the child abuse experts testified the child had no such condition.</p>
<p>That’s five blood experts and seven skin experts against the conclusion of only two doctors who are trained to find and support a conclusion of abuse, and only that conclusion.</p>
<p>And the courts have sided with the two. As John and Sadie found out, <strong>the system right now is blatantly unfair, and children are the ones who suffer most. </strong>
</p>
<p>John and Sadie’s precious daughter is once again without a stable family to love and protect her. Why? Because the system is unjustly stacked against parents. <strong>“What has and is happening is not medicine,” Dr. Sadie Dobrozsi told NBC for their report. “It is ego and arrogance and power. And it has to end.”</strong>
</p>
<p>But it won’t end until more people know. And that’s where the Parental Rights Foundation comes in, where you and I  come in.</p>
<p>Because even as brazen as the child-grabbers have become, even investigating court officers and accusing doctors in their own hospitals, there are still so many who do not know.  John and Sadie certainly didn’t know.</p>
<p>
<strong>Parents and professionals alike would join our cause and stand for family rights if they knew these things were going on. And that kind of outcry would bring change.</strong>
</p>
<p>That’s why we have to tell them.</p>
<p>That’s why<strong> we featured this problem of child abuse pediatricians in our online article </strong>just a few weeks ago. It’s why we launched the Parental Rights Podcast in January, and why a recent episode featured UNC law professor Maxine Eichner to discuss this very topic.</p>
<p>It’s why <strong>we’ve allied with like-minded experts from across the political spectrum </strong>who are crying “foul” on the very same issues, including author-attorney Diane Redleaf and NYU law professor Martin Guggenheim.</p>
<p>It’s why other podcast guests have focused on <strong>everything</strong> from anti-family bills introduced in states around the country to creating an understanding of parental rights as natural, <strong>not government-granted,</strong> rights.</p>
<p>The need to educate and inform America about the plight of parental rights is what prompted us to file an amicus brief in a Texas Supreme Court parental rights case in December—a case that may ultimately find its way to the US Supreme Court.</p>
<p>And it’s this need to educate and inform that led us to propose new model legislation to protect the due process rights of innocent parents like John and Sadie, to ensure they’ll get their day in court <em>before</em> their name ever goes on a child abuse register.</p>
<p>
<strong>It is thanks to the hard work of our team and faithful partners like you, FName, that we have been able to do these things this year— things we have never done before.</strong>
</p>
<p>Now, as our fiscal year comes to a close on March 31, we’re trying to do something else we’ve never done: finish in the black for a fourth consecutive year.</p>
<p>It’s not just a feather to stick in our cap. Fully funding the work we have done this year puts us in the best position to continue our work into the next fiscal year and beyond. It’s good business sense, good stewardship. But again, we’re going to need your help to do it.</p>
<p>Will you support the briefs, the reporting, the model policies and laws that defend families, with a generous gift today to support the Parental Rights Foundation?</p>
<p>No one else is entirely dedicated to preserving the rights of parents against these gross violations. No one else is solely focused on protecting innocent families from this kind of trauma and abuse.</p>
<p>We have big goals for this next year, like growing the reach and effectiveness of our podcast, and seeing the Texas Supreme Court case through to the end. <strong>We want to further more policies that protect innocent families, and bring healthy changes to the whole system of child welfare.</strong>
</p>
<p>Will you take a moment today to <a href="http://parentalrightsfoundation.org/donate">support us in the fight</a> for families like these, families just like yours? Your gift will make all we do and are going to do possible.</p>
<p>Thank you for your faithful support of this vital cause. Together we can make a difference and change our country for the better.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>James R. Mason<br>
President</p>
<p>P.S.<strong> Families like John and Sadie’s are counting on us to continue the work </strong>of calling attention to their plight and working to end the arrogant overreaches that have so harmed their children. We want to see fewer families like Maryanne Godboldo’s, Justina Pelletier’s, or Dr. John Cox’s torn apart. Because, as the court officer and these doctors have found out recently,<strong> no family is safe until we all are.</strong>

<![CDATA[<p>A new proposal in Minnesota would create a constitutional provision that <strong>“all children have a fundamental right to a quality public education,”</strong> which could threaten the natural and constitutional right of parents to decide what form of education is best for their child.</p>
<p>While the availability of a free public education has been a hallmark of American society since the eighteenth century, so has the freedom to choose whether to use it or to select a private or home education for one’s family.</p>
<p>Today, a few progressive academics like James Dwyer posit that <strong>children belong to the state, and that the government must regulate all forms of education. </strong>They want to ensure that children are raised not only to know the information but also to think the thoughts that the government has approved for them.</p>
<p>Radicals have been saying this for a long time, but when their extremist ideas become proposed new laws, we have to fight back.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">
<strong>Precedent Favors Parents</strong>
</h4>
<p>
<strong>You and I know that this radical notion directly conflicts with settled Supreme Court precedent. </strong>
</p>
<p>In 1925, the court confronted an Oregon law that required all students to attend public schools only. The court’s ruling in <em>Pierce v. Society of Sisters</em> was clear:</p>
<p>The fundamental theory of liberty upon which all governments in this Union repose excludes any general power of the state to standardize its children by forcing them to accept instruction from public teachers only. The child is not the mere creature of the state; those who nurture him and direct his destiny have the right, coupled with the high duty, to recognize and prepare him for additional obligations.</p>
<p>And on this point, even the international community agrees (with the troubling exception of several members of the UN’s Committee on the Rights of the Child). In response to the rise and success of the Hitler Youth movement, the United Nations in 1948 adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights Article 26, which holds that <strong>“Parents have a prior right to choose the kind of education that shall be given to their children.”</strong>
</p>
<p>But Supreme Court precedent and international declarations notwithstanding, <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bills/bill.php?b=Senate&amp;f=SF3977&amp;ssn=0&amp;y=2020">Minnesota House File 3658 and Senate File 3977</a> seek to challenge this rule.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">
<strong>Unprecedented and Unnecessary</strong>
</h4>
<p>By establishing that “<em>all</em> children have a fundamental right to a quality <em>public </em>education” (emphasis added), this constitutional amendment would open the door to legally challenging a parent’s decision to use any other method to teach their child.</p>
<p>
<strong>Never in our nation’s history has the government had the authority to decide what form of education children must receive, and we have no desire to see Minnesota lay claim to it now. </strong>It is parents, not government, who know their child best and are most qualified to make beneficial decisions  on the child’s behalf.</p>
<p>The stated aims of the proponents of H.F. 3658 are admirable. They would demand that their state live up to its obligation to provide quality, effective education for those who use the public schools. A lot of public resources go into paying for schools; the people should be able to require accountability for the way those dollars are spent and the quality of the product their children receive.</p>
<p>But as Home School Legal Defense Association Senior Counsel Michael Donnelly testified before the Senate E-12 Finance and Policy Committee last week, “there is currently no constitutional or statutory obstacle to achieving [these] goals.”</p>
<p>
<strong>If the state wants to make their public schools better, they already have the authority to do it. They don’t need to rob parents of their right to choose alternative forms of education for their child.</strong>
</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">
<strong>Catastrophic Potential</strong>
</h4>
<p>In fact, the amendment, if adopted, would have the opposite effect of its stated purpose. Should the change result in the elimination of alternative forms of education, the public schools, robbed of any form of competition, would have even less incentive to improve the quality of education they provide.</p>
<p>Even if the schools got worse than ever, students or parents would have nowhere else to go.</p>
<p>We don’t really expect that would be the result (though it could be). Rather, we anticipate years of legal wrangling and court challenges until a federal court, on the strong precedent of <em>Pierce v. Society of Sisters</em>, sends the Minnesota constitutional language to the dustbin.</p>
<p>
<strong>But do Minnesota lawmakers really want the future of their society to hinge on the decision of perhaps one swing-vote judge? That is not how good policy decisions should be made.</strong>
</p>
<p>And what happens in the meantime? Either children are forced into public schools against their parents’ convictions, or parents defy the law and create an opportunity for social services to come knocking. Once again, children are the ones hurt by anti-parent policies.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">
<strong>Parent Champions Rise to the Challenge?</strong>
</h4>
<p>We must fight these bills now to keep bad policy from hurting good families.</p>
<p>Thankfully, we are off to a good start.</p>
<p>We’re grateful for Michael Donnelly and others who testified against this resolution last week, and we are already standing with them to oppose this dangerous proposal. <strong>We are also honored to have been represented in the hearing by the many active parental rights champions</strong> who turned out to lend their support to Donnelly’s position.</p>
<p>But vigilance is not cheap, and ParentalRights.org is completely donor funded—supported by parental rights champions just like you. To help fight this and similar threats, <strong>could you make an investment in our ongoing efforts through your gift today?</strong>
</p>
<p>Further, if you live in Minnesota, <strong>please take a moment to contact your lawmakers and urge them to stand against this proposed constitutional amendment.</strong> You can easily connect with your senator through the VoterVoice tool available on <a href="https://hslda.org/content/legislation/?vvsrc=%2fcampaigns%2f71889%2frespond">this page on HSLDA’s website.</a>
</p>
<p>Parents, not the state, have a fundamental right to direct the education of their children. We will oppose any provision in any state that would threaten to rob our families of this right.</p>
<p>Thank you for standing with us as we oppose government overreach, intended or otherwise, in Minnesota and throughout the United States.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Michael Ramey<br>
Executive Director</p>

<![CDATA[<p>In February, Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) introduced a resolution, <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-resolution/854?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22HRes854%22%5D%7D&amp;s=5&amp;r=1">House Resolution 854</a>, to call for the US Senate to ratify the<strong> United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child</strong> (the Convention, or CRC). In so doing, she once more opened the door—or at least knocked on it—for international law to override parental rights in our country.</p>
<p>On November 20, 1989, the UN General Assembly approved the CRC and opened it for ratification. Within ten months, the requisite 20 nations had adopted the treaty, bringing it into force. Since then, every nation except the United States has ratified the CRC.</p>
<p>The United States signed the treaty under President Bill Clinton in 1995, signaling our intention to become a party to it. But<strong> it has never been ratified with the constitutionally required consent of two-thirds of the Senate as our Constitution requires,</strong> so we remain the lone holdout.</p>
<p>But there are three solid reasons we cannot, we <em>must</em> not, join the Convention.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">
<strong>Treaty Provisions: ‘Best Interest’ Standard</strong>
</h4>
<p>The first reason we must not ratify the CRC is the content of the treaty itself. While on the surface it appears to be a well-intentioned set of aspirations to bring freedom and safety to children around the world, <strong>the CRC contains some “poison pills” that we must not accept.</strong>
</p>
<p>The worst of these is a provision that states, “in all matters concerning children, the best interest of the child shall be the primary consideration.”</p>
<p>It sounds so good. What could be better than “the best interest of the child,” right?</p>
<p>But for the government to make “best interest of the child” its primary consideration, it must first decide—and get to decide—what the best interest of the child actually is.</p>
<p>In our courts today, a judge or bureaucrat doesn’t get to make that determination without first reaching a finding that the child’s parents are unfit (abusive or negligent). Until then, American law presumes that “natural bonds of affection lead <em>parents</em> to act in the best interests of their child” (<em>Parham v. J.R.</em> (1979), emphasis added). So who decides what your child’s “best interest” is? You do, not the government.</p>
<p>
<strong>The CRC would change that by removing this presumption that favors parents and jumping straight to the part where a judge or bureaucrat gets to decide. <em>In every case.</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>There are other poison pills in the treaty, as well, such as a child’s “right to access information,” which could be used to override a parent’s efforts to protect their child from pornography or other harmful web content; or a “right to access to medical care,” which can be used to cut parents out of their child’s medical decisions <em>even more than they already are</em>.</p>
<p>But the content isn’t the only problem with the CRC.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">
<strong>The Committee on the Rights of the Child</strong>
</h4>
<p>The second reason we must not ratify the CRC is the Committee on the Rights of the Child (the Committee), an oversight panel set up by the provisions of the treaty. Since beginning their work in 1990, the Committee has exercised<strong> unchecked authority</strong> in deciding what the treaty does or does not mean and what nations must do to be in compliance.</p>
<p>Consider, for instance, the prohibition of corporal discipline. It isn’t even mentioned in the treaty. When the CRC was proposed and adopted, fewer than 10 nations worldwide had any kind of ban on the practice, and no nation expressed any concern that it violated the rights of children.</p>
<p>But the Committee, of its own accord and with nothing in the Convention to support it, began telling nations that they were not in compliance because they had not outlawed corporal discipline of children in every setting, including the home. As a result, dozens of nations have since enacted such laws, believing it is their international treaty obligation to do so.</p>
<p>Perhaps you are not a fan of corporal discipline anyway. But don’t let that distract you from the process at work here. <strong>Nations are bullied to change their laws—not to comport with the treaty they voluntarily adopted, but to please a committee that makes up the rules as they go along.</strong>
</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">
<strong>The CRC and the US Constitution</strong>
</h4>
<p>And that brings us to the third and biggest reason we must not adopt this treaty: under Article VI of our own Constitution, a ratified treaty becomes “the supreme Law of the Land.”</p>
<p>So ratification of this treaty, which for other nations is an aspirational statement at best (and for many, such as Iran, China, and North Korea, a mere political smokescreen), <strong>in America would have the effect of passing a massive new federal law on the family.</strong>
</p>
<p>Today, nearly all family law is at the state level. And these statutes, as bad as some of them are, are still bound by the Constitution and our courts to respect the role of parents as their child’s first and best line of defense.</p>
<p>
<strong>Under the CRC, those laws would become the responsibility of the United States Congress, and respect for parents would be gone.</strong> Our system—the CRC system—would then depend on judges and bureaucrats to decide what is in a child’s “best interests” as defined by Congress, and ultimately, as defined by the CRC.</p>
<p>No, not the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The <em>Committee</em> on the Rights of the Child.</p>
<p>Because ratifying the Convention would leave it to that elitist, foreign committee to decide when or if our treatment of children was acceptable under the CRC.</p>
<p>But you and I know that parents, except in extreme cases, are the ones who love their children most and know what is best for them.</p>
<p>
<strong>How is a foreign committee supposed to know what is best for your child <u>better than you do</u>?</strong>
</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">
<strong>We Steadfastly Oppose</strong>
</h4>
<p>Fortunately, there is no significant threat of the CRC being taken up by President Trump or sent to the Senate, and there is no significant threat of this Senate giving its two-thirds consent.</p>
<p>But as long as lawmakers like Rep. Omar want to keep bringing it back up as a great project our nation should undertake, <strong>we will lift our voice to remind them why that would be a horrible idea for our children.</strong>
</p>
<p>Thank you for standing with us as we protect parental rights from <em>all</em> threats to the family, including those that come from international law.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>You are one of only a few who can call right now to push the Florida “Parent’s Bill of Rights” past a major roadblock in the Florida Senate legislative process.</p>
<p>Almost two months ago the “Parents’ Bill of Rights” was introduced as S.B. 1634 in the Florida Senate, along with its companion bill, H.B.1059, in the House. Parentalrights.org staff and volunteers, including state coordinators Jim and Patti Sullivan, have worked hard to get these bills introduced, and it is a MAJOR victory to get this far.</p>
<p>
<strong>But yesterday in committee one senator—<em>your</em> senator—halted all our progress.</strong>
</p>
<p>It’s not too late to save the bill and pass these vital parental rights protections, but it will be up to you. <strong>As a constituent, you are among the only people who can reach him.</strong>
</p>
<p>We have thousands of supporters throughout Florida, but only a few hundred in your district, and many of those will not open this email. <strong>It is vital that every one of you reading this please take action today.</strong>
</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">
<u>Action Item</u>
</h4>
<p>In order for this bill to pass, we need you to urge state Senator Tom Lee to vote “yes” on S.B. 1634 in the Senate Rules Committee, its final committee. Senator Lee is a key vote in this committee. Without his vote, S.B. 1634 will not be heard on the Senate floor in time for it to be passed this session.</p>
<p>The Senate Rules Committee meets this coming Monday, March 2<sup>nd</sup>.</p>
<p>
<strong>Please call or email Senator Lee and urge him to vote “yes” on S.B. 1634 this Monday</strong>.</p>
<p>Time is short. If the bill does not pass the Rules Committee this Monday, it will fail in this legislative session.</p>
<p>By our records, Senator Lee is your Senator; <strong>your voice – <em>and only your voice</em> – will carry a lot of weight with him</strong>.</p>
<p>When you call, say something like this in your own words:</p>
<p>
<em>I am calling as a constituent to urge Senator Lee to vote YES on SB 1634, the Parents’ Bill of Rights, in the Senate Rules Committee. Parental rights are close to my heart, and I truly believe we need to protect our children by preserving parental rights in state law. The enduring American legal tradition that parents can best care for their children should be protected once and for all.</em>
</p>
<p>Also, here are a few things to remember when you call the Senator’s office:</p>
<ul>
<li>You will most likely not talk to the Senator.
<ul>
<li>More often than not, you will speak to his legislative assistant or an intern, but they will convey your message to the Senator.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Always be polite and pleasant on the phone:
<ul>
<li>Often the person you will be talking to will not be the most agreeable. As the “first line of defense,” they take calls all day, many of which are not nearly as friendly as we strive to be. Give them a little grace; they will greatly appreciate it.</li>
<li>One of the easiest ways of sounding more pleasant on the phone is to smile as you talk. It comes through on the other end, and they will be able to “hear” you smile.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don’t be stressed making calls
<ul>
<li>Remember that you are fighting for an amazing cause.</li>
<li>Also, remember that there are other people in your district calling the senator as well. You are not alone.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<strong>We have seen more <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://em-ui.constantcontact.com/em-ui/em/page/em-ui/email#" target="_blank">parental rights </a>rallies in the last two years than ever before, and they are having a powerful effect for the cause.</strong>
<br>
<br>To understand how important this is, one first needs to know that ParentalRights.org is almost entirely a grassroots organization. We do not host these rallies; state-level grassroots volunteers do. And<strong> our volunteer leaders are amazing.</strong>
<br>
<br>Last week, a parents’ rights rally at the state capitol in Minneapolis, Minnesota, was a rousing success. Led by state coordinator Angie Gallagher and a team of allies, last year’s first annual rally brought out between 1,300 and 1,900 supporters and stood as the largest rally on any given issue for the entire legislative session.<br>
<br>
<strong>This year’s rally was attended by more than 2,000 supporters, making it an even bigger success than last year’s.</strong> In coordination with the event, a Parents’ Bill of Rights was introduced in the legislature the same day as <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bills/bill.php?b=House&amp;f=HF3645&amp;ssn=0&amp;y=2018" target="_blank">House File 3645 (H.F. 3645)</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bills/bill.php?b=Senate&amp;f=SF3513&amp;ssn=0&amp;y=2019" target="_blank">Senate File 3513 (S.F. 3513)</a>.<br>
<br>We can’t guarantee the bill will pass, but one thing is certain: <strong>every time the Parents’ Bill of Rights comes for a vote, lawmakers will remember what their rotunda looked like packed with 2,000+ people who want them to vote “Yes.”</strong>
<br>
<br>That’s been the effect of a series of rallies and events in Florida. <strong>Every time I turn around, state coordinators Jim and Patti Sullivan are heading back to Tallahassee,</strong> sometimes alone, but often with a group or as part of a rally with an allied organization, to push forward a similar Parents’ Bill of Rights there. And they have been getting through.<br>
<br>This morning the bill was heard in the Senate Rules Committee, its sixth and final committee hurdle. With a favorable report, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2020/1059" target="_blank">House Bill 1059 </a>and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2020/1634" target="_blank">Senate Bill 1634 </a>are both ready to be voted on by their respective houses.<br>
<br>If passed, <strong>those bills would mean protection for innocent Florida families,</strong> thanks to the hard work of our state volunteers. <br>
<br>More state leaders are looking to duplicate these successes in their own states.<br>
<br>For starters, ParentalRights.org Pennsylvania will host a rally at the Capitol in Harrisburg on Wednesday, March 25, to promote House Bill 508, the Parental Rights Protection Act. This will be their second rally, following a successful event I was honored to attend in September of last year.<br>
<br>More&amp;nbsp;details on that rally will be coming out shortly, so <strong>watch your email or our website for that alert.</strong>
<br>
<br>Then, in late April or early May, Lansing, Michigan, will be the site of that state’s first parental rights rally. Plans for that event are still being made, so details will be forthcoming once they’re available. <strong>If you live in Michigan, watch your emails for that announcement coming soon.</strong>
<br>
<br>Rallies don’t always make sense in every state. To have a successful rally, there needs to be a clear action our lawmakers are being asked to take—like supporting S.F. 3513 in Minnesota, or H.B. 1059 in Florida. And it helps to have well-connected allies, like Minnesota Vaccine Freedom or the CHAP homeschool support group in Pennsylvania, already in place to help get the word out.<br>
<br>But where they do succeed, rallies start with volunteers ready to plan a day and urge people to be there.<br>
<br>
<strong>If you are interested in launching a rally (or just want to check on the status of things) in your state, email our contact coordinator today at <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="mailto:Cory@ParentalRights.org" target="_blank">Cory@ParentalRights.org</a>.</strong>
<br>
<br>We are so grateful for the leaders in these states who are putting in such work to make these rallies (and the bills they support!) a success. And we are grateful to you for supporting them through <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://parentalrights.org/donate" target="_blank">your gifts</a>, your prayers, your attendance, or just your being part of the team.<br>
<br>We couldn’t do any of it without you! <br>
<br>Sincerely,</p>

<![CDATA[Mark your calendar! On Wednesday, March 25<sup>th</sup>, ParentalRights.org Pennsylvania is hosting our second Parents Know Best Rally in Harrisburg, PA.

We’re organizing this event to support Pennsylvania House Bill 508 – The Parental Rights Protection Act – a vital piece of legislation that works to keep the government in check.
<p>
<strong>“You&amp;nbsp;have rights antecedent (pre-existing) to all earthly governments; rights that cannot be repealed or restrained by human laws; rights derived from the Great Legislator of the Universe.” John Adams.</strong>
</p>
Your rights as a parent are fundamental to your existence as a human being; they are yours to enjoy and uphold. The government does not grant those rights to you; it exists only to keep those rights protected and secure.

On March 25th, make sure that your state representatives are securing your fundamental parental rights: urge them to co-sponsor HB 508, a bill which will restrain government, not families.


Join us at the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/Cdb2WUtTVZkkzEpW9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-link-type="web">Pennsylvania State Capitol</a>:
501 NORTH STREET, HARRISBURG, PA 17120


Here is the schedule for the day:
<ul>
<li>9:30 – 10:30 AM – Rally, Main Rotunda of the Harrisburg Capitol Building</li>
<li>10:30 – 11:30 AM – Lobby Training, Room 108, Irvis Building</li>

<![CDATA[<p>Last week in Florida, 6-year-old Nadia King was taken from her public school by police and committed to a mental health facility, all before her mother was contacted or notified.</p>
<p>Fortunately, change is coming to Florida—but it looks like it can’t get there soon enough.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">
<strong>Another Victim of the Baker Act</strong>
</h4>
<p>Under a 50-year-old Florida law called the “Baker Act,” <strong>a mental health professional can place a child in a mental health facility for testing via involuntary commitment <em>without parental consent</em>
</strong> if the mental health professional deems the child to be a threat to the safety of themselves or others.</p>
<p>“The law was meant to allow intervention in cases of imminent danger, said Mark Cavitt, the director of Pediatric Psychiatry at Johns Hopkins All Children’s Hospital in St. Petersburg,” according to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2020/02/16/nadia-king-florida-baker-act/">an article in The Washington Post</a>. Instead, <strong>Baker Act is used too often “because of inadequate training or resources for mental health inside the school system.” </strong>
</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.tampabay.com/news/education/2019/12/10/floridas-flawed-baker-act-rips-thousands-of-kids-from-school/">a report from the Tampa Bay Times</a> last year, roughly 7,500 Baker Act incidents have occurred since 2012—roughly 1,000 per year. That’s more cases than just those involving “imminent harm.”</p>
<p>Nadia did throw a temper tantrum at school. Though she was perfectly calm, even “pleasant” by the time officers picked her up, faculty reported that she had been throwing items around the room. It is possible someone was going to get hurt.</p>
<p>But is it really the kind of mental breakdown demanding involuntary commitment to an institution? Or could it be “merely a negative reaction to stress,” as Enrico Gnaulati suggests in <em>Back to Normal: Why Ordinary Childhood Behavior Is Mistaken for ADHD, Bipolar Disorder, and Autism Spectrum Disorder</em>?</p>
<p>Gnaulti points out that schools today confront children with academic and social expectations beyond the children’s levels of development, while simultaneously taking away “the means to cope with that stress—animated, kinetic, imaginative play.”</p>
<p>Perhaps most shocking of all is that, <strong>despite the school’s claims that they made efforts to “de-escalate” the crisis before Nadia was hauled off, apparently none of those de-escalation efforts included contacting the girl’s mother.</strong>
</p>
<p>By the time Martina Falk learned her daughter was having a tantrum, Nadia was already on her way to the mental health facility.</p>
<p>Fortunately, however, the days of schools, doctors, counselors, and others intruding into the private lives of families may be coming to an end in the Sunshine State.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">
<strong>Parents’ Bill of Rights to the Rescue?</strong>
</h4>
<p>While by no means a response to the Baker Act, <strong>Senate Bill 1634 and House Bill 1059, companion bills proposing the Parents’ Bill of Rights, would strengthen the role of parents like Martina in the lives of their children.</strong> By clearly outlining various rights parents have in raising their children, the law would keep the child’s caregivers from being cut out of these vital child-healthcare decisions.</p>
<p>This concept should already be a no-brainer. The US Supreme Court in 1979’s <em>Parham v. J.R.</em> made clear that, because children are not able to make wise and informed decisions for their own health care or mental health much of the time, “parents can and must make those decisions.”</p>
<p>
<em>Parents.</em> Not teachers, or administrators, or even a third-party psychiatric evaluator.</p>
<p>Sure, there are times emergency intervention is necessary, such as when a teen is suicidal (or even homicidal). <strong>But such interventions should be saved for times that actually are emergencies.</strong>
</p>
<p>Thankfully, the Parents’ Bill of Rights has been having a better month than Martina and her daughter have.</p>
<p>Already passed by the House Education and Health and Human Services Committees, H.B. 1059 passed the House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday, February 18—its final house committee vote. Its next stop is the full House.</p>
<p>Its counterpart, S.B. 1634, has already passed the Senate Judiciary Committee and Senate Education Committee and awaits a hearing and vote in the Senate Rules Committee. Only then can it be voted up or down in the full Senate.</p>
<p>Should each bill pass its respective house, the crossover is mainly procedural. We even have early indications that the governor is aware of the bill and ready to sign it into law.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">
<strong>“You Don’t Own My Vote”</strong>
</h4>
<p>Of course, not everyone likes the Parents’ Bill of Rights. Planned Parenthood of Florida and Florida Equality have both been present and vocal against the bills in multiple committee hearings.</p>
<p>I’m told that, in one hearing, a minority Democratic committee member told Planned Parenthood’s representatives, “<strong>You didn’t buy me and you don’t own my vote.</strong> <strong>I know what you want me to do. But the parents in my district are the ones who put me here. They voted for me. <em>And they want to have a say in their children’s lives.</em>”</strong>
</p>
<p>It’s my personal favorite “If only I could have been a fly on the wall” moment from all these hearings. How I would love to have seen a video of that! (And not because it was Planned Parenthood, but because it was <em>any</em> special interest group rising to oppose the natural legal rights of parents.)</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">
<strong>Conclusion</strong>
</h4>
<p>If passed, the Parents’ Bill of Rights will not suddenly halt all the abuses of the 50-year-old Baker Act. But it will raise the status of parents in the eyes of courts, schools, and administrations throughout Florida—and that itself should help to reduce abuses like the one Nadia and her mother suffered last week.</p>
<p>In fact, families like theirs are the reason we fight to preserve parental rights in every state, and why we are so excited to see these gains in Florida!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Michael Ramey</p>
<p>Executive Director</p>

<strong>Next Thursday, February 20<sup>th</sup>, ParentalRights.Org Minnesota and Health Choice Minnesota are hosting the second annual Health and Parental Rights Rally</strong>. The event will take place at the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/npMaAKFF8QnX6TFMA">Minnesota State Capitol</a> at 2 PM, Central Time.</p>
<p>Last year, we packed the Capitol rotunda with 1,900 people, while half the state was shut down with subzero whiteout weather conditions – this year, we can do even better. Help show our state lawmakers how much we’ve grown! <strong>Restrictive laws and regulations have swept legislatures nationwide, allowing the government to invade our homes, </strong>all while state authorities have been distracted with battling corruption.</p>
<p>From CPS overreach to school choice to special needs and more, we have many issues to tackle. Please join us next week in showing our legislators that the power is in the people, and <strong>the people of Minnesota stand for freedom!</strong>
</p>
<p>You can find out more about the rally and sign up to attend on our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1926285017518005/?active_tab=about">Facebook event page</a>. <strong>I hope to see you there!</strong>

<![CDATA[<p>Anonymous reporting hurts children. So why would a Nebraska bill extend anonymous reporting even to mandated reporters? Such a move would threaten parental rights and traumatize countless children.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">
<strong>The Numbers Are Grim</strong>
</h4>
<p>Nationally, about 83% of all child abuse or neglect investigations result in a finding of “unfounded” or “unsubstantiated.” This means that, even after the obviously phony calls are weeded out, only one report in six involves actual abuse or neglect.</p>
<p>
<strong>When the case begins with an anonymous report, the instance of actual abuse or neglect falls to an abysmal 4%. </strong>In other words, for each instance where abuse or neglect occurs, <em>24 innocent families</em> face the trauma of a CPS investigation.</p>
<p>These numbers paint a clear picture: taking anonymous calls draws more innocent families into the trap of child welfare investigations, with no evidence that any more child abusers are discovered in the process.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">
<strong>Misunderstanding the Law</strong>
</h4>
<p>So why would Nebraska want to allow even mandated reporters to call in anonymously?</p>
<p>It turns out the impetus behind the bill was likely a misunderstanding based on false information, one we hope is soon rectified.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://nebraskalegislature.gov/bills/view_bill.php?DocumentID=40995">Nebraska Legislative Bill 975</a> would remove from the state’s mandatory reporting law the requirement that the reporter give his or her name and address when giving the report. Further, it would prohibit the Department of Health and Human Services from requiring “such person’s name or address for purposes of making such report.”</p>
<p>In other words, <strong>
<em>any report in Nebraska could be anonymous</em>, even if it’s the mandated report of a doctor, teacher, or other child-centered professional.</strong>
</p>
<p>But we’ve learned the author of the bill is not fueling this push personally. Rather, she was advised that the change was necessary for Nebraska to comport with new federal regulations. If Nebraska law doesn’t change, she was told (erroneously), Nebraska would lose a lot of federal dollars.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">
<strong>The Truth Comes Out</strong>
</h4>
<p>Fortunately, friends of parental rights got wind of the bill last week and a number of groups, including our friends at Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA), were able to inform lawmakers of the error. Attorney Dan Beasley also spoke to lawmakers on ParentalRights.org’s behalf.</p>
<p>When the bill was heard in committee on Friday, lawyers for the state’s Department of Health and Human Services repeated the false claim that the change is necessary to keep federal funding. <strong>But newly informed lawmakers pushed back, questioning and probing the assertion until the lawyers <em>finally conceded that no such requirement exists</em>.</strong>
</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the hearing, the committee chose not to act on the bill Friday, giving us a chance to talk with lawmakers yet again. While we don’t yet know the final outcome of this one, we do know that the admission that the change is not required, along with the concerns for children expressed by many parents, has opened the eyes of several Nebraska senators.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">
<strong>Moving Forward</strong>
</h4>
<p>We will stay on top of L.B. 975 in Nebraska, as well as many bills across the country that threaten parental rights, and we will let you know if they start to move.</p>
<p>(L.B. 975 has other provisions that have nothing to do with family privacy, so an amended version that omits anonymous reporting would not pose a threat to your parental rights. But until the bill is amended, we will continue to track it and keep you informed.)</p>
<p>
<strong>By working together with grassroots supporters, allied organizations, and even lawmakers themselves, we can protect families from further erosion of their rights such as the misunderstanding behind L.B. 975 might have caused.</strong> So please consider investing in the cause today at ParentalRights.org. And continue to follow (and share!) our newsletters, watching for important updates in <em>your</em> state.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Michael Ramey</p>
<p>Executive Director</p>

<![CDATA[<p>We need all parental rights champions in Virginia to <em>call your delegate today</em> and urge them to <em>oppose</em> House Bill 386, which would illegalize counseling that helps a teen reduce or eliminate unwanted same-sex attraction.</p>
<p>Yesterday, H.B. 386 passed the House Committee on Health, Welfare, and Institutions by a vote of 18 to 4. Its next stop, a full vote on the floor of the House of Delegates, could be scheduled for any day—even as soon as today.</p>
<p>This will be the last meaningful opportunity to halt this discriminatory bill.</p>
<p>
<strong>Background</strong>
</p>
<p>If the aim of H.B. 386 is to stop dangerous counseling practices, such as electroshock therapy, it is woefully inadequate and yet overbroad. The bill never mentions or restricts any particular method of counseling.</p>
<p>Instead, it discriminates against the counseling aim of helping a teen reduce or eliminate unwanted sexual attractions to another person of the same sex.</p>
<p>
<strong>The aim of the bill is not to curb practices, but to discriminate against families and youth who <em>want to be “straight,”</em>
</strong> denying them—and only them—the right to choose their own sexual identity and future.</p>
<p>
<strong>It also discriminates against all teens who struggle with same-sex attraction, by denying them—<em>and only them</em>—the judicially recognized right to have their important health and welfare decisions made with their parents and not by some agent or officer of the State.</strong>
</p>
<p>In <em>Calabretta v. Floyd</em>, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals declared, “The government’s interest in the welfare of children embraces not only protecting children from physical abuse, but also protecting children’s interest … <em>in the lawfully exercised authority of their parents</em> [emphasis added].”</p>
<p>HB 386 would rob only same-sex attracted youth of this vital legal interest.</p>
<p>
<strong>Action Item</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Please take a moment right now, before you close this email, and call your Virginia delegate.</strong> (You can find their contact information<a href="https://whosmy.virginiageneralassembly.gov/"> here</a>.) Urge them to vote “No” on H.B. 386.</p>
<p>You can use your own words, use arguments from the above “Background” section or our earlier emails on this bill, or simply tell them the following:</p>
<p>“I am a constituent, and I’m calling to urge you to vote ‘No’ on H.B. 386. This bill discriminates against families on the basis of their counseling goals, without actually outlawing any particular counseling methodology. And it robs sexual minority youth of the right to make their own health-care decisions with their parents by imposing a one-size-fits-all, cookie-cutter course of action predetermined by the legislature. This wrongs our youth and it wrongs our families.”</p>
<p>
<strong>Thank you for making your voice heard and for standing with us to protect children by empowering parents.</strong>
</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Michael Ramey</p>
<p>Executive Director</p>

<![CDATA[<p>
<strong>On Wednesday, January 29, at 10:30 a.m. EST, ParentalRights.org President Jim Mason will go on Facebook Live to interview United States Senator Mike Lee of Utah.</strong>
</p>
<p>Lee, a constitutional legal scholar, has long been a friend to our mission and a supporter of the Parental Rights Amendment.</p>
<p>Jim and Senator Lee will discuss two bills the Senator has recently introduced in the U.S. Senate.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/3138/text">3138, “The PARENT Act,”</a> would require hospitals and health-care facilities to post vital information about their policies regarding the provision, withdrawal of, and parental consent for life-sustaining procedures. These facilities would also have to notify patients about their policies related to parental notification and consent for do-not-resuscitate orders.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/3137?s=1&amp;r=4">3137, “The Parental Right to Know Act,”</a> would require those same facilities to include information on parental access to medical records of children under the age of 18 on their website and in print, upon request of the patient or parent.</li>
</ol>
<p>While neither bill would change any hospital’s life-sustaining procedure policies (such a bill would have <em>no chance</em> of passage in the current divided Congress), <strong>both will inform parents of existing procedures so that they can make the best available decisions for their child.</strong>
</p>
<p>Just last week, I sat down with leaders of the Teri Schiavo Network for Life and Hope to discuss the shocking ways <strong>parents of terminally ill or traumatically disabled children are robbed of their right to make best-interest decisions for those children, just when they need them most.</strong>
</p>
<p>Lee’s bills will help strengthen parents in those unfortunate situations by giving them notice going in of what the hospital’s policies are and how the parents and patients can best exercise their rights.</p>
<p>
<strong>So if you are able, take a moment tomorrow, Wednesday, at 10:30 a.m. EST, to tune in on Facebook and hear Senator Lee.</strong>
</p>
<p>And if you haven’t already done so, you’ll want to check out our new Parental Rights Podcast as well. New episodes come out every Tuesday at 2 p.m. EST. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/22yOW4gs2mCemObY6V7yhe">You can find the latest installment here.</a>
</p>
<p>Finally, invite your friends to join you on both Facebook Live and the podcasts.<strong> Let’s work together to bring awareness to the cause of parental rights with these new tools!</strong>

<![CDATA[<p>The faith-based counselling ban bill we alerted you to last week in the Virginia Senate (SB 245) has a companion bill in the House, HB 386, which is on the move as well.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=201&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB386&amp;submit=GO">
<strong>HB 386</strong>
</a>
<strong> passed out of the Subcommittee on Health Professions on Thursday (1/23), and is scheduled for hearing TOMORROW, Tuesday, January 28, before the full House Committee on Health, Welfare, and Institutions.</strong>
</p>
<p>If HB 386 passes this committee, it could be heard in the full House within a couple of days, meaning it could come up for its <em>last meaningful vote this week</em>.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">Background</h4>
<p>Traditionally, adolescents struggling through the many challenges of “becoming,” of sorting out who they are and will be as an adult, have turned to their parents for wisdom and guidance, and all the more when they face special struggles along the way. &amp;nbsp;<strong>HB 386 would remove options from parents and their teens who may struggle with sexual feelings <em>they do not want</em>.</strong>
</p>
<p>The U.S. Supreme Court declared in 1979 that while adolescents often lack the capacity for judgment to make decisions regarding their physical or mental health care, “parents can and must make those judgments.” <em>Parham v. J.R.</em> (1979). When it comes to addressing same-sex attraction, HB 386 would eliminate this important legal presumption that protects families.</p>
<p>HB 386 does not outlaw any particular kind of therapy, but only <em>the aim</em> of reducing or eliminating same-sex attraction. <strong>Even “talk therapy” with that goal in mind would be outlawed under this measure.<br>
</strong>
</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">
<strong>Action Item</strong>
</h4>
<p>Please call or email your Virginia Delegate today and urge them to vote “No” on HB 386. If they are on the committee, they could hear this bill tomorrow; if they are not, they still may hear it this week. So, <strong>call your Delegate <em>in either case</em> and urge them to oppose.</strong>
</p>
<p>Your message can as be simple as: “My name is _______ and I am a constituent of the Delegate (<em>or</em> a voter in their district). I urge you to vote ‘No’ on HB 386, a bill that would rob parents and their teens of the right to make the best treatment decisions for the child’s unwanted sexual desires or their choice of sexual identity.”</p>
<p>You might also add, “I am disturbed that this bill would outlaw a viewpoint rather than any particular method.”</p>
<p>Thank you for taking this stand today. Families throughout the Commonwealth are counting on you to speak up for them.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<![CDATA[<p>
<strong>Virginia <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=201&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb580&amp;submit=GO">HB 580</a>, which would insert troubling language into the state’s child abuse provision, is scheduled for a hearing before the Social Services Sub-Sommittee of the House Health, Welfare, and Institutions Committee on Thursday, January 23 (tomorrow!)</strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span style="color: #800000;">
<strong>UPDATE</strong> January 23, 2020: The Sub-committee did not get to HB 580 today. We will watch for the next time it is scheduled. Meanwhile, please contact your lawmakers to oppose this dangerous bill.</span>
</em>
</p>
<p>This bill would add to the current definition of an “abused or neglected child” one “<i>whose parent or other person responsible for his care creates or inflicts, threatens to create or inflict, or allows to be created or inflicted upon such child a physical or mental injury on the basis of the child’s gender identity or sexual orientation.</i>” This will widen the net and ensnare even more innocent families in unwarranted child welfare investigations.</p>
<h3>
<strong>Analysis</strong>
</h3>
<p>Growing children ask: who am I? What am I? Parents have the right to help answer those questions in an atmosphere free from the fear of being investigated for child abuse. Parents have the right to guide a child away from behavior that will be harmful to the growing child’s sense of identity.</p>
<p>
<strong>This bill undermines those rights by threatening to treat loving, discerning parents like child abusers.</strong>
</p>
<p>Currently, 83% of child welfare investigations nationally are closed as “unfounded” or “unsubstantiated.” CPS investigations are themselves traumatic events for many children. This bill is likely to increase the number of investigations, <a href="https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/faculty_scholarship/1266/">
<em>causing more harm to more children than it will help</em>
</a>.</p>
<p>The statute gives no definition of “mental injury.” It is possible, or even likely, that anything a parent does or says that the child does not like would be construed as “mental injury.” But <strong>parents know instinctively that allowing a child to do exactly what they want all the time can lead to serious harm.</strong>
</p>
<p>Mentoring a child through the growth process of discerning wants, needs, and emotions and preparing a child for independent decision-making as an adult are truly crucial parts of parenting.</p>
<p>Because children are children, they tend to think and act primarily with the short term in mind.&amp;nbsp; Parents have the life experience to see and help their children grow to understand things from a long term and broader point of view.&amp;nbsp; <strong>Children benefit from the parent’s more mature perspective and modeling of the decision-making process.</strong>
</p>
<p>In order to preserve the right of parents to direct the upbringing of children, ParentalRights.org opposes this bill.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>The new Virginia legislature didn’t waste any time launching an all-out assault on parental rights.</p>
<p>
<strong>In the opening hours, the House of Delegates and the Virginia Senate took up four pieces of legislation that are troubling for families:</strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+SB32">SB 32</a> would outlaw spanking with “an inanimate object.”</li>
<li>
<a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+HB386">HB 386</a> would outlaw “conversion therapy” for minors.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+hb580">HB 580</a> would expand the definition of child abuse to include parents who “inflict physical or mental injury on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation.”</li>
<li>
<a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+SB104">SB 104</a> would allow minors (no age restriction) to consent to CDC recommended vaccinations if a medical person thinks the minor has “the ability to understand at the same comprehension level as an adult the risks and benefits associated with vaccinations and immunizations.”</li>
</ol>
<p>
<strong>For ParentalRights.org, the bill to expand the definition of child abuse or neglect, which is still in committee, is a crisis point.</strong>
</p>
<p>Historically, we as an organization have stayed away from the political hot-buttons in our effort to protect the unity around parental rights. A Zogby poll from 2010 showed that 92% of Democrats, 97% of Republicans, and 91% of Independents agree that “parents have the constitutional right to make decisions for their children without government interference unless there is proof of abuse or neglect.”</p>
<p>
<strong>But these bills have brought the hot-button issues to us.</strong> They are not merely sexual orientation bills; they go right to the heart of parental rights.</p>
<p>HB 580 especially, which adds to the definition of child abuse, would widen the net of “child welfare” that is too broad already. As it stands, 83% of all child abuse investigations nationally turn out to be “unfounded” or “unsubstantiated.” Children are stripped from their parents or otherwise traumatized even though no wrongdoing has occurred.</p>
<p>
<strong>HB 580 would add to the number of victims of this broken system.</strong>
</p>
<p>The Supreme Court has held that “most children, even in adolescence, simply are not able to make sound judgments concerning many decisions, including their need for medical care or treatment. <strong>Parents can and must make those judgments.</strong>” <em>Parham v. J.R</em>., 442 U.S. 584 (1979) at 603, emphasis added.</p>
<p>But both HB 580 and HB 386 seek to do away with this legal presumption.</p>
<p>In our current political climate, we’re not “supposed to” oppose sexual orientation bills. I have even been asked if ParentalRights.org is “anti-LGBTQ,” so let me state this plainly: <strong>We are not “anti-LGBTQ;” we stand for the right of <em>all</em> fit parents to make the best decisions for their own children, regardless of the sexual orientation or gender identity <em>of the parent or their child</em>.</strong>
</p>
<p>If someone believes we should withhold support for a parent’s rights on the basis of these things, it is that someone who is discriminating on that basis, not this organization.</p>
<p>This is the battleground on which parental rights are being attacked today, so it is the battleground on which we must defend those rights. And we are proud to do so.</p>
<p>So I urge you to consider stepping up your support, whether it’s through a <a href="http://parentalrights.org/donate">donation to the cause</a> or simply stating your positive opinion on social media. We will have detractors and we will lose a few supporters, so it will fall to the rest of us to fill in the gaps.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">
<strong>Some Good News</strong>
</h3>
<p>Thankfully, Virginians have already been on high-alert since election day, <strong>and public outcry has already removed two of these threats.</strong> SB 32 on corporal discipline has been tabled until the 2021 session, and SB 104 on minors consenting to vaccines was pulled by its sponsor in committee. This means it is no longer under consideration.</p>
<p>That they were offered in the first place, however, shows the scope of control over children that this legislature wants to wrest away from fit, innocent parents.</p>
<p>The vaccination bill was especially telling.</p>
<p>While parents in Virginia are legally able to acquire an exemption from vaccinating their child on the basis of their religious beliefs, <strong>SB 104 would have allowed a medical professional to coerce a child into overriding their parent’s religious objection.</strong> Not unsurprising, however, the bill would not have allowed a child with a religious objection to vaccines to override a parent’s decision to give the child the inoculation.</p>
<p>So the child’s authority to grant legally binding consent (and this was a child of any age!) would only exist if the child wanted to give consent for, not if the child wished to withhold consent from, a vaccination. In short, there was to be no consent at all—just a power grab by the state. The sponsor was wise to withdraw this proposal.</p>
<p>
<strong>ParentalRights.org opposes the remaining bills, Virginia HB 386 and HB 580, on the basis that they violate the time-honored, natural right of parents to make medical and mental health decisions for their children</strong>. We will continue to oppose similar bills in the future, in every state.</p>
<p>(Virginia residents oppose HB 386 companion bill SB 245 <a href="https://parentalrights.org/va-bill-to-ban-counselling-coming/">here</a>).</p>
<p>Thank you for standing with us, in Virginia or whatever state you’re in, as we fight to protect children by empowering parents even on the hot-button issues of our day.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Michael Ramey</p>
<p>Executive Director</p>

<em>
<strong>ALERT:&amp;nbsp;</strong>(Jan. 23, 2020) — HB 386, the companion bill to SB 245 (described below) will be heard before the <a style="color: #800000;" href="https://virginiageneralassembly.gov/house/members/members.php?subcommittee=H12002">Health Professions Sub-Committee</a> of the House Health, Welfare, and Institutions Committee TODAY at 5 p.m. Please call your Delegate on the subcommittee and urge them to vote “No.”</em>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://legiscan.com/VA/bill/SB245/2020" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-link-type="web">SB 245</a>, a bill that would prevent parents from seeking counselling for their children who may struggle with their sexual identity or experience unwanted same-sex attractions, passed a senate committee Thursday morning and will go to the senate floor for a vote any day now.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;<a href="http://www.familyfoundation.org/blog-posts/bill-targeting-faith-based-counselors-up-tomorrow" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-link-type="web">Here</a>&amp;nbsp;is a bulletin with additional details from the Virginia Family Foundation. (Note that it was written prior to the committee vote Thursday.)</p>
<hr>


<hr>


<p>
<strong>Please take a moment right now to call your Virginia senator and urge them to oppose SB 245.</strong> (Find your senator’s <a href="https://apps.senate.virginia.gov/Senator/index.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-link-type="web">contact information here</a>.) A vote could take place as early as Monday, January 20, so it’s vital that they hear from you today.</p>
<hr>


<hr>

<h3>Background</h3>

<hr>


<p>Traditionally, adolescents struggling through the many challenges of “becoming,” of sorting out who they are and will be as an adult, have turned to their parents for wisdom and guidance, and all the more when they face special struggles along the way.&amp;nbsp;<strong>SB 245 would remove options from parents and their teens who may struggle with sexual feelings <em>they do not want</em>.</strong>
</p>
<hr>


<hr>


<p>The U.S. Supreme Court declared in 1979 that while adolescents often lack the capacity for judgment to make decisions regarding their physical or mental health care, “parents can and must make those judgments.” <em>Parham v. J.R.</em> (1979). SB 245 wants to do away with this important legal presumption that protects families.</p>
<hr>


<hr>

Please make your call today for the sake of children and their families all over the Commonwealth.

<![CDATA[<p>The new legislative year is underway across the country, and in Florida and Colorado we’re championing promising bills to protect parental rights.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-parental-rights-podcast/id1494175980">(For more about the Florida bills and the Florida legislature’s committee challenges, check out this week’s Parental Rights Podcast with special guest, ParentalRights.org State Coordinator Patti Sullivan.)</a>
</p>
<h3>
<strong>Colorado HB 20-1063</strong>
</h3>
<p>In Colorado, Rep. Tim Geitner has introduced the “Fundamental Family Rights in Colorado” bill, <a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb20-1063">HB20-1063</a>. As introduced, the bill would add a new section to Colorado law stating that <strong>“the liberty of a parent to exercise his or her parental rights is a fundamental right in the state of Colorado,”</strong> and that this right is to be protected by strict judicial scrutiny.</p>
<p>The bill further defines parental rights as “the right of a parent to direct the upbringing, education, and care of the parent’s child.”</p>
<p>In the face of so many assaults on parental rights across the country, this kind of protection for reasonable parental decision-making in Colorado will be a welcome change.</p>
<p>Rep. Geitner is also working with us and some of our bipartisan coalition allies to introduce a bill that would provide for <strong>due process before a name can be added to the state’s child abuse registry.</strong> That bill doesn’t have a number yet, but we fully support it (as we do the Fundamental Family Rights bill) and we’ll get you that number as soon as we can.</p>
<h3>
<strong>Florida HB 1059 / SB 1634</strong>
</h3>
<p>Meanwhile in Florida, Rep. Erin Grall and Sen. Kelli Stargel have introduced identical bills to create a “Parents’ Bill of Rights.” At twelve pages long, the bills would add a new Chapter to Florida law defining and protecting parental rights in detail.</p>
<p>“The Legislature finds that <strong>it is a fundamental right of parents to direct the upbringing, education, and care of their minor children,”</strong> the bill declares. “The Legislature further finds it is necessary to establish a consistent mechanism for parents to be notified of information relating to the health and well-being of their minor children.”</p>
<p>The bill then lists a number of specific parental rights and how they are to be protected, while also spelling out that <strong>parents’ rights include more than just those listed in this legislation.</strong>
</p>
<p>This is not the first year parental rights legislation has been introduced in Florida. The Parents’ Bill of Rights last year made it through two committees in the House and one in the Senate before running out of time for a final vote.</p>
<p>This year, Grall’s <a href="https://www.myfloridahouse.gov/Sections/Bills/billsdetail.aspx?BillId=69227&amp;">HB 1059</a> and Stargel’s <a href="https://www.myfloridahouse.gov/Sections/Bills/billsdetail.aspx?BillId=69485&amp;">SB 1634</a> are “companion bills,” introduced concurrently to allow the measure to work its way through both houses at once. This is especially helpful in Florida, where a bill must pass three committees of each chamber in a limited amount of time.</p>
<p>
<strong>While HB 1059 works its way through the House, SB 1634 will make its way through the Senate.</strong> If each one gets through its house of origin before the session ends, the bill will be ready for the governor to sign into law.</p>
<h3>
<strong>Coordinated War on Parental Rights Looms</strong>
</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, not all state legislatures are looking to protect parental rights this year. In next week’s email we will look at <strong>one state’s coordinated all-out war on parental rights, and what we are doing to stop it.</strong>
</p>
<p>In the meantime, thank you for standing with us. It is only through the support of our individual partners that we are able to push for parental rights law in these positive states, or stop violations of those rights when “all-out war” breaks out. <strong>Consider giving today to fuel us to victory</strong> especially in Florida and Colorado this year (and to halt the many threats we will take on at the same time).</p>
<p>Then, <strong>keep watching these newsletters in the weeks ahead so you can respond as needed when action occurs in <em>your </em>legislature.</strong> Also, check out the podcast and share it with your family and friends to further spread the word on this vital issue.</p>
<p>Together we will win the war for our children by preserving our parental rights.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>
<strong>The Pardo family in Texas was finally reunited after several months, all accusations against the parents dropped.</strong> (They had been accused of seeking medical care their 4-year-old didn’t need, though the court would later find that every treatment he ever received had been prescribed by his attending physicians.)</p>
<p>A group in Minnesota is currently working out a settlement in a class action lawsuit against Hennepin County to correct unjust practices in the county’s Child Protection System.</p>
<p>And in Illinois another group of parents are advancing a lawsuit of their own against a hospital where babies were taken away and given the vitamin K shot without the parents’ approval, <em>even though state law guarantees to parents the right to make that decision.</em>
</p>
<p>Such is the trend in America today: <strong>more and more eyes are being opened to the improper handling of children through the violation of parental rights.</strong> More and more people are taking a stand to demand the changes that need to be made.</p>
<p>The system has been broken for decades, but its dysfunction has been hidden in shadows. Things begin to change when more and more light reaches those recesses.</p>
<p>
<strong>This year was ParentalRights.org’s twelfth year in being a huge part of shining that light.</strong>
</p>
<p>In the first half of the year we coordinated with a bipartisan coalition and proposed real changes to Congress that could be employed through the reauthorization of the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, or CAPTA.</p>
<p>Congress has so far failed to pass any meaningful change, but in the process <strong>we fine-tuned what it is we’re looking for, and discovered additional ways to go after it.</strong>
</p>
<p>So over the summer we started drafting model state statutes that could have the same effect, a state at a time.</p>
<p>In the last quarter, we finalized that language in preparation for the 2020 legislative sessions.</p>
<p>In the last month, we spoke with lawmakers interested in prefiling these parental rights bills.</p>
<p>In the last two weeks, <strong>our president attended the policy summit of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC)</strong> to present our concerns and encourage state lawmakers to take a stance protecting families. <strong>His presentation has resulted in new contacts—new state lawmakers looking to take up our ideas.</strong>
</p>
<p>Now, even as things wind down for the holidays, we are gearing up for the legislative session coming in January. States like Colorado, South Dakota, Kentucky, and Florida will be taking up bills to protect parental rights and save children from unnecessary intrusion and trauma.</p>
<p>
<strong>Thank you for standing with us throughout 2019, and for continuing the journey together in 2020.</strong>
</p>
<p>Together we are shining a light and making a difference!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Michael Ramey</p>

<![CDATA[<p>
<em>Innocent until proven guilty.</em> Even elementary school students can tell you this is one of the cornerstones on which our nation is built.</p>
<p>So how is it <strong>parents can be added to a child abuse register without first having a hearing and a chance to defend themselves?</strong> To be listed as a sex offender, one must be found guilty of a crime in a court of law. But no such requirement exists to be labelled a child abuser. How can this be?</p>
<p>How is it an investigator can intrude into a family’s home with no evidence, no warrant, and only an anonymous phone call? For all they know, the caller was a teenage prankster. Or, more likely, an unhappy ex-lover or spouse.</p>
<p>These are rhetorical questions. <strong>We don’t need them answered; <em>we need them stopped.</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>That’s why our president, Jim Mason, attended a policy summit of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) last week in Arizona.</p>
<p>He presented to lawmakers and other policy shapers our concerns about threats to parental rights, especially centering on these two concerns. And he took with him model language that will address both issues—due process prior to a child abuse registry listing, and eliminating anonymous hotline calls.</p>
<p>And<strong> we are already seeing results.</strong>
</p>
<p>Before the ALEC conference concluded, before Jim could get on the plane to return home,<strong> a Colorado lawmaker had already contacted me expressing interest in filing family rights bills, including our model to require due process.</strong>
</p>
<p>We’re talking with lawmakers in other states as well, including Indiana and Florida, to resume efforts to pass parental rights legislation that we started (or continued) last year but didn’t quite pass.</p>
<p>And we’re working alongside allies from across the aisle on these reform efforts. While the lawmaker I’ve spoken with is in the minority party, <strong>there is every reason to expect broad bipartisan support when the bills reach the legislature in January.</strong>
</p>
<p>The Supreme Court has consistently upheld a “private realm of family life which the state cannot enter.” <em>Prince v. Massachusetts</em>, 321 U.S. 158 (1944), at 165. But that realm is no longer as secure as it once was or as safe as it <em>needs to be.</em>
</p>
<p>Families in America—including, perhaps, many of yours—have experienced the trauma of an anonymous, false report, or even being added to the state registry without a hearing.</p>
<p>Working with allies from across the political spectrum and with lawmakers in a growing number of states<strong>, we are ready to turn the tide and see innocent families once again safe</strong> in their “private realm.”</p>
<p>Over the next few weeks, things will rightly slow down for the holidays—a slow down we welcome, along with many of you.</p>
<p>But when we turn the calendar to 2020, <strong>we will hit the ground running and continue the long struggle to preserve your family and your parental rights.</strong>
</p>
<p>Thank you for standing with us for that “private realm of family life.”</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Michael Ramey</p>
<p>Executive Director</p>

<p>Our goal for one-day giving was $30,000: half from matching grants secured in advance, and the other half from all of you.</p>
<p>While we fell a little short of our goal, <strong>we at the Parental Rights Foundation are incredibly encouraged by the support each one of you showed us</strong>. Through your generous donations and by sharing our content online, you all pulled together to show incredible support for this crucial cause. And your support has given us an encouraging push as we finish up this year’s goals.</p>
<p>As I look forward to starting the new year,<strong> I am overwhelmed with your out-pouring of generosity to empower parents to protect their children.</strong> We take seriously our obligation to make the best use of your gifts to continue to change the way families are treated throughout America.</p>
<p>I wish I could thank each of you individually and in person; <em>you are simply the best. </em>
</p>
<p>Thank you so much for fueling the fight for parental rights!</p>

<![CDATA[<p>As we gather with our families this year, we will be giving thanks for you! We are beyond grateful for your courage and faithfulness to stand with us to defend families through the protection of parental rights.</p>
<p>Thanks to you, we have been able to speak up before the Texas Supreme Court through an amicus brief in support of parents. And for the second year in a row we got to call the Administration’s attention to the plight of innocent American families abroad, this time resulting in a meeting between a mom and the embassy in Norway.</p>
<p>And you have fueled our work with a bipartisan coalition to build model legislation for the states that will provide due process protection.</p>
<p>Imagine if an innocent parent could no longer be added to the child abuse register without credible supporting evidence. Your partnership with us is moving us toward that day!</p>
<p>So thank you, from the bottom of our hearts.</p>
<p>Our Parental Rights Foundation family wishes you and yours a Happy Thanksgiving!</p>
<p>Warmly,</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Michael Ramey</p>
<p>Executive Director</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S. — Come and see us! Giving Tuesday is one week away, and we will be taking a video tour of the nation’s capital, Washington, D.C. Plan to join us December 3 for the fun on social media and to be part of the giving to protect children by preserving parental rights.</p>
<p>And if you’re in the area, come out and join us in D.C. We’d love to interview you for our Facebook and Instagram audiences! If you’re interested, email <a href="mailto:Cory@parentalRights.org">Cory@parentalRights.org</a> to coordinate when and where we can meet you!</p>

<![CDATA[<p>We’ve said it for months: If more people knew what innocent families suffer in the name of “child protection,” they would join us in doing something about it. Now NBC News and the <em>Houston Chronicle</em> are shining a light on that very thing.</p>
<p>In what has so far been a three-part series, <strong>the two news sources have highlighted the plight of families in Texas damaged by the work of “child abuse pediatricians,”</strong> a new subspecialty in medicine designed to spot and prosecute child abuse.</p>
<p>At least on the surface, the new subspecialty is well-intentioned, and we do not doubt there are many in the field who legitimately want to help. But detractors, including the Parental Rights Foundation, warn that the new specialty is more about the convenience of keeping pediatricians and specialists from having to attend court; let the new child abuse doctor do that.</p>
<p>The series began with the September 19 article, “A Devastating Diagnosis,” available <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/devastating-diagnosis-doctors-trained-spot-child-abuse-can-save-lives-n1055746">at NBS News here</a>. It was continued in “Imminent Danger” on October 10 (available <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Doctors-accuse-moms-of-abusing-their-children-14492174.php">at <em>The Houston Chronicle</em> here</a>); and again November 12 with “Parents Call for Reforms to Protect Families from Mistaken Child Abuse Allegations” (<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/parents-call-reforms-protect-families-mistaken-child-abuse-allegations-n1080926">at NBC News here</a>).</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">
<strong>Put Yourself in My Shoes</strong>
</h2>
<p>The latest installment features families who testified to Texas lawmakers in a recent hearing to bring reform to the harmful system. One family, who was exonerated and finally got their children back from the state after several months, testified <strong>they’d spent $200,000 in legal fees to defend themselves.</strong>
</p>
<p>Lawmakers “appeared shocked” by this, according to the article, but we hear about this all the time. It’s one reason some experts believe families in poverty face more child abuse investigations than families who are well-off: the impoverished can’t afford to fight back. (See, for instance, Dorothy Roberts’ <em>Shattered Bonds:</em> <em>The Color of Child Welfare</em>.)</p>
<p>“I urge this committee to put yourselves in the shoes of my family or one of the many other families here today,” parent Tim Timmerman told the panel, according to the article. <strong>“Think about how you would feel if your child or grandchild was taken out of your arms with no standard of proof other than the opinion of a single individual.”</strong>
</p>
<p>The individual he refers to, of course, is the child abuse pediatrician. Privileged to be part of the “medical team” at the hospital with access to the child’s medical file, this “specialist” serves to gather forensic evidence, not look for a way to help the injured child.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">
<strong>The Child Abuse Pediatrics Racket</strong>
</h2>
<p>They put too much weight – too much trust – in these child abuse pediatricians.</p>
<p>As Diane Redleaf put it in <em>They Took the Kids Last Night</em>, “Unfortunately, the consumers of child abuse pediatric opinions—judges, State’s Attorneys, and CPS investigators—too often believe some child abuse pediatricians’ hype about their superior abilities to discern child abuse over that of orthopedists, radiologists, and neurosurgeons.”</p>
<p>Redleaf also points out that <strong>“[i]f ‘child abuse’ were a diagnosis…[it] seems to me it would be a <em>legal</em> diagnosis, not a medical one.”</strong> (Redleaf, p. 108)</p>
<p>And with no clear scientific evidence, no commonly accepted list of symptoms to look for, and little scrutiny from the system in which they operate, the power of these “specialists” to destroy innocent families is staggering.</p>
<p>“In this process,” the newest NBC/<em>Chronicle</em> article quotes another parent, “you are guilty until [proven] innocent.”</p>
<p>This should not be the case.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">
<strong>Shining a Light of Hope</strong>
</h2>
<p>But there is hope. The fact that the Texas legislature is now listening to these parents is a starting point.</p>
<p>Even more promising is that the <em>Houston Chronicle</em> and NBC News covered these stories in the first place. The <em>Arizona Republic</em> has also made a concerted effort to cover stories like this over recent months, and I’m sure there are other sources doing the same.</p>
<p>
<strong>They’re sharing stories of families torn apart over false allegations of abuse,</strong> with little or no evidence, on the word of a single doctor, or investigator, or even an anonymous phone call.</p>
<p>It is horrible and wrong that these stories take place, but <strong>as we expose these tragedies to the light of public scrutiny, pressure rises on the states to fix the problems and protect the innocent.</strong>
</p>
<p>This is why ParentalRights.org exists, why we share these news stories with you in our newsletters, and why we post them on our social media platforms.</p>
<p>It’s also why we launched our<a href="https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/ask-congress-amend-constitution-include-right-parents-raise-nurture-and-educate-their-children"> <strong>White House petition </strong>
</a>
<strong>last month urging President Trump to ask Congress to take up our Amendment.</strong> We don’t expect Congress to lay aside their impeachment tug-of-war and suddenly work together to preserve parent’s right, but we do hope to shine a public light on the need for them to do so.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">
<strong>Take Action Today</strong>
</h2>
<p>Check out the stories linked above and share them with as many people as you can. Let’s open eyes to the problems with the system, and the frequency with which innocent families are caught in the nets laid out to catch real abusers.</p>
<p>
<strong>Remember when you thought the only people who needed to worry about child services were child abusers?</strong> Some of your friends may still think that, and need to learn otherwise from you.</p>
<p>And while you’re at it, <a href="https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/ask-congress-amend-constitution-include-right-parents-raise-nurture-and-educate-their-children">sign the White House petition</a> and share that with all of your friends, as well. We have only ten days left, and a long way to go if we are to reach 100,000 signers and earn a response.</p>
<p>Thank you for taking action today, and for standing with us to shine the light, get the word out, and protect children by empowering parents!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Executive Director</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Are you ready to shine a new light on parental rights?</p>
<p>We have just launched a plan that will see President Donald Trump address the Parental Rights Amendment.</p>
<p>Love him or hate him, President Trump draws media attention.  The press examines and reports on everything he does.</p>
<p>So we’ve launched a campaign to get him to weigh in on our Amendment, which we believe will help draw more attention to this vital cause.  But it’s going to take all of us to make it work, and additional resources to support the follow-up. That’s why I’m writing you today.</p>
<p>On September 22, 2011, then-President Barack Obama launched a program on the White House website allowing anyone to set up a petition to the President. Under the program, any petition receiving at least 100,000 signatures within a 30-day time period would receive a response from the Executive Office.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump has continued this program—committing himself to speak to <strong>your</strong> issue—and we are going to take advantage of it.</p>
<p>The plan is simple.</p>
<p>We have posted a <a href="https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/ask-congress-amend-constitution-include-right-parents-raise-nurture-and-educate-their-children" target="_blank" rel="noopener">petition on the official White House website</a> calling on President Trump to urge Congress to take up our Amendment.</p>
<p>Legally and constitutionally, the President has no role in amending the Constitution.</p>
<p>
<strong>But that doesn’t mean the President can’t use his powerful influence to call Congress’s attention to the cause.</strong>
</p>
<p>So that’s exactly what we’re petitioning him to do. And he will <em>have to respond</em>.</p>
<p>We launched our petition on the White House website at midnight Eastern time on Thursday, October 24. From that point we had 30 days to reach the required number of signatures.</p>
<p>We’ve already secured our first 5,000 names, and now we’re working to keep the ball rolling.</p>
<p>And that’s where you play a vital role.</p>
<p>It will take all of us working together—volunteers, donors, allies, friends, acquaintances, board members, and staff—to get the petition in front of enough people to reach 100,000 signers. And we only have 26 days left to do it!</p>
<p>It’s an achievable goal. But it will take a lot of work to get the signatures. And even if—<em>when</em>—we succeed, that won’t be the end of it.</p>
<p>Remember, the point of all of this is to draw attention to our cause.</p>
<p>Even with a successful petition, we don’t expect Congress to suddenly drop everything and take up the Amendment. But we’re not looking for a huge, immediate change in Congress. <strong>We’re looking to make changes <em>in their constituents</em>.</strong>
</p>
<p>We want more people like you and me to be aware of parental rights.</p>
<p>They need to know what is happening in America, and why parental rights matter today.</p>
<p>
<strong>Because when people know, they care, and when people care, they fight.</strong>
</p>
<p>That’s why we’re calling attention to the plight of families across the country who have been ripped apart without cause by a “child welfare” system that has too much power and not enough oversight.</p>
<p>People need to know about the fit families being torn apart, and the innocent children who suffer years of trauma from even brief run-ins with wrongful social services cases. They need to know about children like Justina Pelletier, or Corey Widen’s eight-year-old daughter, and the innocent Arizona family. All of them have suffered greatly because parents’ rights are not protected.</p>
<p>These are families who should be able to take their child to the doctor without fear of their child being taken away. Who want to let their kids play outside without rigid supervision.</p>
<p>Families like mine. Families like yours. Innocent families who did nothing wrong, yet suddenly find themselves in the crosshairs.</p>
<p>
<strong>You know it could happen to any of us. At this point, there is no rhyme or reason to who is accused and who isn’t.</strong>
</p>
<p>And you know the underlying reason why these things happen: because parents’ rights are not protected, and that leaves children like Justina—or like <em>your</em> child—vulnerable.</p>
<p>Yes, there are good child welfare agencies out there who respect parents and preserve families.</p>
<p>But there are also maverick agencies with a cavalier attitude toward family and a calloused disregard for parental wisdom or wishes. These “follow their gut,” with no need for evidence and no concern for the trauma their intrusion may cause.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the confidentiality of family courts keeps everyone in the dark, so there is no accountability or oversight.</p>
<p>Fortunately, social media and even mainstream sources are beginning to take notice. Parent groups are beginning to form all over the nation, with some filing lawsuits to call attention to unjust family court practices.</p>
<p>But there is still much work to do.</p>
<p>With this <a href="https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/ask-congress-amend-constitution-include-right-parents-raise-nurture-and-educate-their-children" target="_blank" rel="noopener">White House petition</a>, we will add our own spotlight to the need for parental rights and child welfare reform.</p>
<p>But we won’t be able to take full advantage of this opportunity without your support.</p>
<p>You are a vital part of making the petition a success by sharing it with your friends and urging them to sign on.</p>
<p>Now is the time to tell the people in your life why you care about parents’ rights, to inspire them to carry the torch, too.</p>
<p>
<strong>But sharing the petition is only one part in the journey to protect families.</strong>
</p>
<p>Even when our petition succeeds, when more people are talking about parental rights and more people are signing up to support our cause, we will need you to stand with us as a steady voice of support for justice.</p>
<p>Because there is so much work to be done. And, together, we can do it.</p>
<p>We can’t afford to waste this opportunity to grab the attention of 100,000 new families—or even more!—and make them part of the parental rights community.</p>
<p>Can I count on you to stand with us today, as we take this next step?</p>
<p>Once we have their attention, we will keep it. We’ll show them the defenseless parents and their innocent children—taken from good, loving homes because poverty or disability are labelled “bad parenting.”</p>
<p>We’ll show them our efforts to pass parental rights laws in the various states through our renewed campaigns starting in January.</p>
<p>Perhaps most of all, we’ll show them the permanent solution: The Parental Rights Amendment.</p>
<p>
<strong>We will show new followers that <em>we can win if we don’t give up</em>. But we can’t do it alone. </strong>
</p>
<p>So will you seize the opportunity right now? Your best gift, whether it’s  $5, $50, or $500, will empower us to make the most of this petition campaign.</p>
<p>Because as much as this next month will be fun, exciting, and full of online fanfare for the petition, it is the weeks and months after it is finished that will determine just how far this effort will take us.</p>
<p>With your partnership, we can take a huge step forward in the next 26 days.</p>
<p>Will you stand with families today?</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Jim Mason</p>
<p>President</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S. — Our Parental Rights Petition is the next step in fighting for parents’ rights. We’ll have to put our best effort into it every step of the way, both during the petition and in the follow-up after it ends. Will you be part of this journey with us?</p>

<p>Too often,<strong> state agents invade innocent families without cause.</strong>
</p>
<p>If a parent disciplines a child, it’s “child abuse.” If a doctor disagrees with a parent’s decision on a child’s treatment, it’s “medical neglect.”</p>
<p>And if there’s a hotline call, it doesn’t need to be anything at all. “We got a call, so we have to investigate. Let us in.”</p>
<p>This is <em>not</em> how our society is meant to operate.</p>
<p>So <strong>we’re using the White House petition system to draw attention to the issue and get the word out.</strong>
</p>
<p>The challenge before us is to reach 100,000 signatures in 30 days—and the clock starts Thursday at midnight.</p>
<p>So <strong>watch your email Thursday morning for the link, and plan now to sign the petition and share it with your friends.</strong>
</p>
<p>Thank you for standing with us, and with parents all over the country, to better protect our children and their future!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Michael Ramey</p>
<p>Executive Director</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S.— This email is just a reminder. Check out <a href="https://parentalrights.org/presidential-petition/">our petition page</a> for more details.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Dear [First name],</p>
<p>There will be <strong>a Parental Rights Conference in Flemington, NJ, on October 26<sup>th</sup> from 2:00 to 6:00 p.m.</strong> to <strong>oppose New Jersey Senate bill 1569.</strong> SB 1569, which would change the standards for sex education in New Jersey public schools, raises concerns for many whose beliefs may be offended by the new standards.</p>
<p>Most importantly for the cause of parental rights,<strong> it reduces the options available to parents as they direct the education of their children</strong> in this delicate and personal area of study.</p>
<p>
<strong>ParentalRights.org State Coordinator Victoria Jakelsky</strong> is part of putting this rally together and will be on-hand for the event.</p>
<p>Other allies in the event are faith-based organizations, and the conference is expected to have a strong Christian atmosphere.</p>
<p>Our focus as an organization is on parental rights, not religious freedom, and certainly not any one religious viewpoint. Sometimes, however, these interests overlap, and this is such an event.</p>
<p>The conference will be on private property and registration is required.<strong> To register or to learn more visit the <a href="https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/protect-your-children-parental-rights-conference-tickets-74559339993?aff=ebdssbdestsearch">event’s website here</a>.</strong>

<p>If you have additional questions, feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:Cory@parentalrights.org">Cory@parentalrights.org</a>.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Big news!</p>
<p>Thursday, October 24, <strong>ParentalRights.org will launch a <a href="https://parentalrights.org/presidential-petition/">White House petition</a> urging President Trump to use his considerable influence to push the Parental Rights Amendment in Congress.</strong>
</p>
<p>This is how the White House petition site works: <strong>Once our petition goes live, we will have only 30 days to gain 100,000 signatures.</strong> If we reach that mark by the deadline, the Administration is committed to at least respond to our request.</p>
<p>There’s no guarantee the President will do what we ask. But even if he declines, he will still be drawing attention to parental rights when he does.</p>
<p>Of course, it could be bigger than that.<strong> He could be in favor of our request.</strong> And if he is, it will highlight our cause even more.</p>
<p>Is this going to force Congress to lay aside the last decade of growing dysfunctionality and take up parental rights? Probably not. But<strong> it will help us awaken the American people, and that in turn will lead to the change we—and our children—need to see.</strong>
</p>
<p>So, please help us get the word out <strong>now</strong>, and especially <em>once the petition goes live.</em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>If you are a leader of an organization or group that supports parental rights, </strong>please prepare to share this petition with them as soon as it goes live<strong>.</strong> If we can help you with content or additional information, please contact <a href="mailto:cory@parentalrights.org">cory@parentalrights.org</a>, and she will be happy to help.</p>
<p>And let’s all plan to make a splash by sharing this on social media and other means throughout the 30-day window:<strong> October 24 to November 22.</strong>
</p>
<p>Together, we can reach our goal and draw tremendous attention to the cause of healthy families and parental rights.</p>
<p>Thank you for standing with us in this effort!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Michael Ramey</p>

<![CDATA[<p>
<em>Photo credit: Parentalrights.org. Reps. Jim Cox (left) and David Zimmerman address concerned parents, children, and members of the press before the Parents Know Best Rally in Harrisburg September 24, 2019.</em>
</p>
<p>ParentalRights.org of Pennsylvania on Tuesday hosted the <em>Parents Know Best Rally</em>, their first gathering to support HB 508 at the Capitol in Harrisburg.</p>
<p>Led by State Coordinator (and ParentalRights.org board member) Vickie Suarez, the PRO of PA team also partnered with American Family Association of Pennsylvania and the Christian Homeschool Association of Pennsylvania (CHAP) to organize the event.</p>
<p>ParentalRights.org Contact Coordinator Cory Gibbons and I were on hand for the day’s activities.</p>
<h2>
<strong>Broad Diversity, One Voice</strong>
</h2>
<p>Speakers for the day included Suarez, Diane Gramley of AFA of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia Councilman David Oh, Robert McClellan (M.D.), Homeschool Legal Defense Association attorney Dan Beasley, homeschool activist Maryalice Newborn, and ParentalRights.org board chairman Ethan Demme. Several parents also spoke of their experiences with “the system” that has invaded their families, including six moms who came our from Philadelphia to share their heart-wrenching accounts.</p>
<p>Councilman Oh has been <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/news/david-oh-judo-child-abuse-allegation-20190211.html">making headlines of his own</a> for taking a stand for child welfare reform in his city.</p>
<p>Rep. Jim Cox, lead sponsor of HB 508 (The Parental Rights Protection Act), and Rep. David Zimmerman also spoke to the gathered crowd of concerned parents and children. Both are strong supporters of parental rights and spoke of the important role parents play in their children’s lives.</p>
<p>
<strong>“It’s been a slow erosion,” Cox cautioned, “and we’re not going to get it back overnight. But I believe this [HB 508] is an important first step.”</strong>
</p>
<p>Attendees could have been divided into conservative, rural parents concerned with their right to homeschool and make medical decisions for their children, and urban minority moms who have had run-ins with the state’s Depart of Children and Youth Services.</p>
<p>Only, they weren’t. <strong>No, this crowd was not divided at all, but were of one mind and voice: <em>Parents Know Best</em>.</strong>
</p>
<h2>
<strong>Parents the Experts</strong>
</h2>
<p>“Who understand children better than parents themselves?” Rep. Zimmerman asked rhetorically in his opening remarks. Ethan Demme provided the answer a few minutes later from federal data and statistics.</p>
<p>Studies show, Demme explained, that to become an expert in something takes roughly 10,000 hours. And <strong>the average parent spends 16,000 hours on their child by the time the child is six years old—more than enough time to become an expert.</strong> By contrast, it would take a school teacher, who focusses on that same child for six hours every school day, <em>seventeen years</em> to reach the level of knowledge of that child the parents have achieved by the child’s sixth year.</p>
<p>HSLDA attorney Dan Beasley echoed that sentiment based on studies of home schooled children’s academic excellence. He summed up his findings succinctly: <strong>“If we empower parents, children benefit.” </strong>
</p>
<p>Yet the state looks to other “experts” for how children should be raised, discounting the invaluable knowledge parents hold.</p>
<p>Sadly, that’s the experience other parents were on hand to share.</p>
<h2>
<strong>Mothers with Stories to Tell</strong>
</h2>
<p>Several of the Philadelphia mothers explained that they and their children were victims of <a href="https://parentalrightsfoundation.org/hold-judges-accountable/">Judge Lyris Younge</a>, a discredited Philadelphia judge recently suspended by the state’s judicial authorities. Her removal came in response to a 68-page complaint accusing her of “routinely and improperly jailing parents in child custody matters and stripping them of access to their children without giving them adequate opportunity to plead their case,” according to an <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/news/lyris-younge-judge-philly-judicial-conduct-board-complaint-removal-family-court-20190821.html">August article in the Philadelphia Inquirer</a>.</p>
<p>An historically large percentage of Younge’s cases have been overturned on appeal, but the mothers at our rally have not yet received  justice by that means. Their families, and their hearts, remain broken by the system.</p>
<p>One grandmother shared through tears how a child services supervisor allegedly lied in court, presenting her granddaughter’s rapist as the girl’s father and helping him secure custody of the child he had abused. The little girl was five years old.</p>
<p>The abuse would not have happened if the child had been left in the care of her grandmother, who was already filling the parenting role in her life.</p>
<h2>
<strong>More to Come</strong>
</h2>
<p>The rally was well attended for being the first of its kind, though other issues drew larger crowds on what proved to be an especially busy day in the capital. But this was our first attempt, and we hope to raise larger support for similar efforts in the future.</p>
<p>
<strong>“The opposition is not going to quit,” Rep. Zimmerman stressed in his early remarks. So we can’t afford to stop, either.</strong>
</p>
<p>As an observer, I am proud of our team of volunteers and allies, and what they were able to accomplish. The content and quality of the event were excellent, and helped draw attention to parental rights concerns.</p>
<p>
<strong>More than one person in attendance at the Capitol for other issues stopped to ask for more information on our cause.</strong>
</p>
<p>So keep an eye out for more such events in the future, in Pennsylvania and elsewhere, as we continue to draw attention to the plight of families and the need to preserve parental rights. And thank you for standing with us in this and every endeavor as we strive to protect children by empowering parents together.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Michael Ramey</p>
<p>Executive Director</p>

<![CDATA[<p>It is the purpose of open courts to let in the light of outside scrutiny, to keep judges and child welfare agencies honest in their dealings with children and families. That’s what made one ruling in Arizona earlier this year both troubling and confusing. And it’s why we’re excited to see that ruling overturned.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">
<strong>A Midnight Raid to Take the Children</strong>
</h2>
<p>It started with a mother in Chandler, Arizona, taking her fevered child to the doctor. Unable to rule out a serious illness such as meningitis, the doctor recommended the parents take the child to the emergency room for more testing (which generally entails a painful spinal tap).</p>
<p>By the time mother and child got home, though, the fever had broken. The family consulted a family friend who is a nurse, and ultimately decided the test was not necessary.</p>
<p>
<strong>It was a reasonable medical decision by an informed parent, the kind we all try to make every day.</strong>
</p>
<p>But when the doctor learned the child hadn’t gone to the ER, she called the local Department of Child Safety, who called out the police to raid the home that very night.  The Department had secured a warrant to take the child, and ended up taking two sick siblings, as well.</p>
<p>They didn’t take the children to have them forcibly tested. <strong>The court didn’t issue a warrant to get the test that seemed so important to the concerned physician. </strong>
</p>
<p>No. The warrant was to completely remove the sick children from their parents’ care. The children would ultimately spend weeks in foster care, then months in kinship foster care.</p>
<h2>
<strong>Open Courts, Except When They’re Not</strong>
</h2>
<p>The family had a front door cam, and soon footage of the midnight raid was all over social media. And Arizona has “open family courts,” meaning anyone may attend, and any media may report, as long as the family’s identity is kept safe.</p>
<p>So when this particular case went to a hearing, several interested parties were there, including reporters for the <em>Arizona Republic</em> as well as state lawmaker Kelly Townsend, who recently championed a bill to shore up parental rights in just such cases as this.</p>
<p>
<strong>But that’s when things took a turn for the weird.</strong>
</p>
<p>After the first hearing, presiding Judge Timothy Ryan took issue with an article written by the <em>Republic</em>, and perhaps with comments made by Rep. Townsend. So at the second hearing, Judge Ryan ordered the <em>Republic</em> and Townsend removed from the courtroom. And he issued an order claiming they had “violated confidentiality provisions.”</p>
<p>
<strong>For them, the open courts were officially closed.</strong>
</p>
<p>For months, the eyes and ears of the public were cut off from a hotly controversial case.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">
<strong>Reversals…</strong>
</h2>
<p>In August, the family’s children were returned to their care, the case against the parents dropped. And how could it not be? It is perfectly legal for parents to make informed medical decisions for their children. In fact, it is their natural, fundamental right (and responsibility) to do so.</p>
<p>Only no one knew about that outcome, because the media were still gagged.</p>
<p>Lawyers for the <em>Arizona Republic</em> filed a “motion for reconsideration,” asking the court to explain how their reporters had violated state law, or else restore their privileges to attend.</p>
<p>On further review, the judge had no choice but to overturn his own earlier ruling. <strong>His final finding did not admit wrongdoing or provide any details, but it is clear he could find no justification to support his earlier decision</strong> in light of the paper’s properly filed legal appeal.</p>
<p>Yet, sadly, even that victory was not untainted. Due to a clerical error, the court at first refused to provide the paper’s lawyers the decision on their own case!</p>
<p>“There being no written objection from the Attorney General’s Office, the Guardian ad Litem, or Father, it is ordered granting the motions [to reverse the earlier ruling],” Ryan wrote in a minute entry dated Aug 7, according to this <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-child-welfare/2019/09/12/republic-violate-court-rules-dcs-case-chandler-family-police-raid/2279905001/">
<em>Arizona Republic</em> article</a>. <strong>But the ruling wasn’t revealed to the reporters until early September, a month after the family’s case was over.</strong>
</p>
<h2>
<strong>… and Repercussions</strong>
</h2>
<p>“One of the problems when juvenile courts are closed to the press and the public is that judges often steamroll parents,” ParentalRights.org President Jim Mason told the <em>Republic</em> for their article last week.</p>
<p>Further, the paper’s attorneys wrote, the <em>Republic</em> “has no guidance on what portion of its news report ostensibly violated the confidentiality requirements,” and <strong>“[the paper] will be chilled from exercising its First Amendment rights in the future.”</strong>
</p>
<p>But the public, the press, and even the integrity of the court are not the only victims here. Although the family have been reunited, neither the parents nor the children will soon forget this ordeal.</p>
<p>Studies show many children forced into foster care will spend years in therapy after, trying to regain some semblance of the security they once found at home. And <strong>many score higher on PTSD tests than soldiers returning from combat.</strong>
</p>
<p>We hope that won’t be the case here, and we salute the parental rights champions at the <em>Arizona Republic</em>, along with Representative Townsend, for standing up for the rights of families and of the press.</p>
<p>
<strong>Working together, we will continue to shine a light on the family courts</strong> to bring the changes we need to protect our children by empowering their parents.</p>
<p>Thank you for standing with us in this important crusade!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Michael Ramey</p>
<p>Executive Director</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Changes are coming to a major legislative conference that will better protect your parental rights at the state level.</p>
<p>ParentalRights.org’s Government Affairs Liaison Maggie McKneely attended the annual conference of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) in Austin, Texas, August 14-16, and came away with the encouraging news.</p>
<h3>
<strong>Changing the Structure</strong>
</h3>
<p>“There’s going to be a new subcommittee for [Health and Human Services] issues: CPS, parental rights, that sort of thing,” Maggie told me.</p>
<p>ALEC is a conference of conservative state lawmakers who gather to discuss legislation proposals they’d like to see promoted across the country. It’s a way for a lawmaker from Texas, for instance, to share his successful bill so lawmakers in Oregon, Oklahoma, and Mississippi can introduce it in their states as well.</p>
<p>To be presented to the council, though, a bill must first pass through the appropriate subcommittee, and this has been a sticking point for ParentalRights.org. Since ALEC is a conservative gathering, its committees are gathered around conservative-only themes, like fiscal restraint or pro-life legislation.</p>
<p>Until now, there hasn’t been a subcommittee that fits our issue. But that is about to change.</p>
<h3>
<strong>New Allies</strong>
</h3>
<p>A small number of other groups have also been pushing ALEC to make room for child welfare reform efforts. Maggie was able to meet a leader out of Arizona working on this same kind of legislation.</p>
<p>That particular group is focused on the needs of children in foster care rather than on instances where children shouldn’t have been taken in the first place, but like us, they are working to rein in the system to better protect and care for children. The focus is different, but the results are the same.</p>
<p>It was encouraging for Maggie to make contact with these groups, whose work complements our own.</p>
<p>Because of the presence and persistence of champions like these, including ParentalRights.org, ALEC is preparing a new subcommittee to take up our issue.</p>
<h3>
<strong>An “Everyone Issue”</strong>
</h3>
<p>ALEC hasn’t taken up parental rights or child welfare reform before because it isn’t seen as a conservative issue. And we have said it before ourselves: parental rights is <em>not</em> a conservative issue, nor a liberal one.</p>
<p>The truth is, it is an “everyone issue,” which ALEC is now beginning to see includes conservatives like them.</p>
<p>(If we can score an invitation to a similar exchange for liberal lawmakers, we will be happy to share parental rights with them as well!)</p>
<p>The down side is that ALEC is an annual conference. While we hope to make a presentation of our issue for their executive meeting later this fall, neither the subcommittee nor any legislative proposals we could make will be in place before next August.</p>
<p>But in the grand scheme of things, that’s a small delay for a major avenue to promote our cause.</p>
<p>Thanks to the work of colleagues like Maggie and the new allies she is meeting, meaningful change <em>is on its way</em>.</p>
<p>Thank you for partnering with us and believing in us as we work behind the scenes to make these changes possible.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Michael Ramey</p>
<p>Executive Director</p>

<![CDATA[<p>[Editor’s note: The following is originally from our sister site, <a href="https://parentalrightsfoundation.org/facing-our-biggest-threat-to-parental-rights/">ParentalRightsFoundation.org</a>.]</p>
<p>I’ve been fighting for parental rights for over ten years, and <strong>you might be amazed to hear what I’ve come to believe is the biggest threat to parental rights.</strong>
</p>
<p>Because the biggest threat to the legal rights of families in America today isn’t that more than 2,000 children are removed from their families <a href="https://parentalrights.org/every-three-days/">
<em>every three days</em>
</a> over allegations of abuse or neglect.</p>
<p>It isn’t that an investigator can remove children and rip families apart without a judge first hearing the case or issuing a warrant.</p>
<p>It isn’t that <em>five of every six</em> child welfare investigations are ultimately unfounded or unsubstantiated.</p>
<p>The biggest threat to families in America today isn’t that so many hospitals accuse innocent parents of “medical neglect” just for wanting a second opinion.</p>
<p>It isn’t that hospitals routinely seize custody of children over disagreements with the parents regarding the child’s diagnosis or medical care, or that they’re licensing “child abuse pediatricians” to lend an aura of medical credibility to circumstantial evidence against parents of sick or injured children.</p>
<p>
<strong>No. The biggest threat to the legal rights of families today is that <em>people don’t know these things are going on. </em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>In a moment, I’ll explain what we’re doing to fix that problem and how you can be part of the solution today.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">
<strong>The People They Don’t Know</strong>
</h2>
<p>Most people have never heard of <a href="https://parentalrightsfoundation.org/neglect-dog-walking/">Corey Widen</a>, the mother who had DCFS called on her because she had the audacity to allow her eight-year-old daughter to walk their dog around the block. There were no signs of abuse or neglect, but that didn’t stop DCFS from interviewing family, friends, and neighbors in a process that would take weeks to resolve.</p>
<p>People don’t know about <a href="https://parentalrights.org/new-hope-due-process/">Hope</a>, the New York mom whose name was on the state’s child abuse “central register” for more than a decade because of a false report of neglect stemming from an ugly divorce. They don’t know that, although her child welfare case and all criminal charges were quickly thrown out, her name was added to the registry anyway.</p>
<p>People don’t know about <a href="http://medicalkidnap.com/2016/06/12/medically-kidnapped-teen-isaiah-rider-finally-free-from-child-protective-services-but-ruined-lives-remain/">Isaiah Rider</a> or <a href="https://www.boston25news.com/news/family-of-justina-pelletier-announces-lawsuit-against-boston-childrens-hospital/112745822">Justina Pelletier</a>: two teenagers, two hospitals, two different states. Two difficult diagnoses, and two families doing all they could to help them. <strong>Two innocent children who were harmed both physically and emotionally by our current child welfare system.</strong>
</p>
<p>People don’t know how Lurie’s Children’s hospital in Chicago stripped sixteen-year old Isaiah from his mother because she wanted a second opinion on his care.</p>
<p>They don’t know how Boston Children’s Hospital (BCH) kicked out Justina’s parents when they believed her existing diagnosis of mitochondrial disease instead of being cowed into BCH’s “somatoform” (psychological) disorder diagnosis.</p>
<p>They don’t know BCH called in the state of Massachusetts to take custody of the teen, who went from relatively healthy, walking and skating, to using a wheel chair during her sixteen months in state “care.”</p>
<p>People don’t know about the young cancer patients being removed from their parents over decisions regarding chemotherapy. They aren’t aware that <strong>so many children are being forced to face the scariest days of their lives alone, without the comforting presence and support of their parents.</strong>
</p>
<p>People don’t know—often it seems even the judges don’t know—that judges can issue a court order to take the choice about chemo away from the parents without taking the parent away from her ailing, terrified child.</p>
<p>People don’t know about <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-49077718">Tafida Raqeeb</a>, a desperately ill 5-year-old in Great Britain whose mother is fighting to save her from “medical experts” who believe it’s in the girl’s “best interests” to just let her die. Just like <a href="https://parentalrights.org/learning-from-charlie-gard/">Charlie Gard</a> and <a href="https://parentalrights.org/alfie-evans/">Alfie Evans</a> before her.</p>
<p>
<strong>People don’t know these nightmares don’t just happen to ‘bad parents,’ but to normal, good, loving parents like you and me.</strong>
</p>
<p>They don’t know the cause behind all this suffering: that our government’s refusal to protect their rights has left their family at risk.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">
<strong>What People Who Know <em>Don’t</em> Know</strong>
</h2>
<p>
<strong>You know who <em>does</em> know these things happen to good parents? The ones who have been there. The innocent families living the nightmare <em>right now.</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>But even they are equally harmed by the things <em>they </em>don’t know.</p>
<p>Too many of them don’t know that even when a child welfare investigator is banging down their door <em>they still have rights</em>. They don’t know that their instinct is right; that being forced to stand by while an investigator strip-searches your child without a warrant is <em>wrong</em>.</p>
<p>They hear “professional investigators” tell them their children are better off without them, and some of them begin to think it’s true.</p>
<p>Because they don’t know what their rights are, or how to defend them.</p>
<p>
<strong>Worst of all, they don’t know that they are not alone,</strong> that people like us support them and are working to end their nightmare. They don’t know that <em>you</em> believe in their right to be a parent.</p>
<p>And what all these people have in common—those living the nightmare and those who have never heard it exists—is that they don’t know this is a <em>huge</em> problem in America.</p>
<p>When I talk to them, people are shocked that they know so little about such a big issue. I hear it all the time: “Why is no one talking about this?”</p>
<p>
<strong>But this is exactly why the Parental Rights Foundation exists: to educate America on the threats to parental rights and on the best policies to preserve our families.</strong>
</p>
<p>Because what you don’t know <em>can</em> hurt you.</p>
<p>And what so many Americans don’t know about parental rights is exactly what’s causing so much pain to so many children.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">
<strong>If They Knew What You Know</strong>
</h2>
<p>If more Americans knew our government removes children from homes at a rate of more than 2,000 every three days, there would be an outcry against it. If they knew more than 80% of trafficked children came from the foster care system, they would demand change.</p>
<p>If they knew a child abuse “central registry” is a list of people <em>accused</em> of abuse—often without any evidence—and not of actual abusers, they would stop using those lists in hiring practices. And they would demand a better list they could count on, one with due process built in.</p>
<p>
<strong>But they don’t know, so they don’t care.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>And that’s the problem. </strong>
</p>
<p>Because until they care, we will never see the changes we need to preserve innocent families like Hope’s, and to save innocent children like Isaiah and Justina.</p>
<p>Until they care, we will not have the strength to stop the British atrocities against Alfie Evans, Charlie Gard, and Tafida Raqeeb from coming to our shores as well.</p>
<p>
<strong>Until they care, families like yours and mine are not truly safe.</strong>
</p>
<p>It is up to you and me to open their eyes, to educate them. If we do that, many will care and will take a stand to defend parental rights.</p>
<p>Do you remember when you first learned of the threats to parental rights in America today?</p>
<p>
<strong>Remember that first moment you realized something must be done?</strong>
</p>
<p>The truth is, an <a href="https://secure.parentalrights.org/np/viewDocument?orgId=parentalrights&amp;id=4028e4e55c813888015cfa25822f00ff">amazingly large majority</a> of Americans still agree that parents generally know what is best for their child. We still recognize that, as a rule, “natural bonds of affection lead parents to act in the best interest of their child”—better than a teacher, a doctor, a bureaucrat, or any agent of the state.</p>
<p>That means if we can open their eyes, they’ll have the same kind of reaction you did.</p>
<p>Parents from across the political spectrum, from every race and creed, agree with us on the natural role of loving parents as a child’s first and best defense.</p>
<p>
<strong>Americans of every stripe will stand with us to protect parents’ rights through good laws, good policies, even a good constitutional amendment. <em>But we have to open their eyes.</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>Every month, the Parental Rights Foundation sends hundreds of thousands of emails and shares dozens of social media posts to raise awareness to the plight of families in America.</p>
<p>We write letters to policymakers and engage in debates and discussions with opinion influencers to defend the family by protecting parental rights.</p>
<p>We research and investigate new trends in parental rights and keep our supporters abreast of the latest parental rights news, both dangers and successes.</p>
<p>Through all these efforts we strive to raise awareness, to open eyes, to let people <em>know</em>.</p>
<p>
<strong>But we cannot do any of these things without the partnership of great supporters like you, supporters who <em>know</em> and want to make a difference.</strong>
</p>
<p>Parental Rights Champion, can I count on you today to make your <a href="https://secure.parentalrights.org/np/clients/parentalrights/donation.jsp?campaign=3&amp;&amp;test=true">best gift of $35, $50, or even $125</a> to strengthen our efforts to open more eyes? Your investment will further the work of the Parental Rights Foundation to bring discussion and awareness of parental rights into every home in America.</p>
<p>Standing together, we can help Americans know what they don’t know—then take action to bring real change for families.</p>
<p>Thank you for working with us to shine the light of knowledge and understanding in the area of parental rights!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Michael T. Ramey</p>
<p>Executive Director</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S. — America has a major parental rights problem because so many people just don’t know. They don’t know the dangerous trends of hospitals and child welfare investigators overriding parents with whom they disagree. They don’t know of the victims—Justina, Isaiah, Hope, and so many others—harmed by a system intended to protect. <strong>If we can open their eyes, we can build an army of people who care, who stand, who act to defend our families by preserving parental rights.</strong> Can I count on you to act – to give your most generous gift today and sustain our efforts to open their eyes?</p>

<![CDATA[<p>A recent case out of Washington state was so egregious the appellate court not only rejected it, but sent it back to be heard again—<em>in a different county</em>.</p>
<p>Generally, when a case is appealed, the appellate court will either uphold the original decision or “remand” it, meaning they send it back for a do-over, with special instructions from the higher court.</p>
<p>
<strong>But <a href="https://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/769642.pdf">this case</a> required the court to come up with a whole new option.</strong>
</p>
<p>“The right to a fair trial before an impartial tribunal is a basic requirement of due process,” Justice Smith wrote for a unanimous Court of Appeals for the State of Washington. “The right to due process is especially critical in a proceeding to terminate parental rights, where so much is at stake for both the parents and the child.”</p>
<p>But the Appeals Court determined that the Snohomish County termination of parental rights trial for parents Nylysha Aradon and Carey Hayes was anything but impartial.</p>
<h2>
<strong>Background</strong>
</h2>
<p>It all began with the birth of a baby on February 24, 2013. When “A.H.” was born, her mother tested positive for methadone. Four days later, the Department of Social Services removed the baby from her parent’s custody and sent her to live with a foster family.</p>
<p>This situation—where a mother tests positive for methadone at birth—is one of the concerns we have with the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, or CAPTA. The mother’s positive drug test resulted in an automatic call to DSS as a result of CAPTA.</p>
<p>But testing positive for methadone isn’t always a bad thing. Methadone is often prescribed to help mothers with alcohol addiction get off alcohol, especially during pregnancy. And studies have shown that methadone use is safer for both mother and baby than quitting alcohol cold turkey during the pregnancy.</p>
<p>We don’t know this family’s details. We don’t know if the methadone was prescribed or if the mother was under her doctor’s care. We’re not taking a position on whether this baby was a “child in need of care.” Frankly, neither did the appeals court. They were simply concerned, as are we, with the parents’ inability to get a fair trial before their rights were terminated.</p>
<p>
<strong>And there certainly is reason for concern.</strong>
</p>
<p>According to the court’s finding, a Volunteer Guardian Ad Litem (VGAL) for the infant stood strongly opposed to returning the baby to her mother and “committed numerous breaches of confidentiality that benefited the foster parent.” In one example, she dug up case files from previous DSS involvement with the parents and gave a copy of the file to the foster family.</p>
<p>She misinformed the parents as the baby’s food needs changed based on new allergy tests, and she blocked the parents from access to the child’s medical providers.</p>
<p>When the VGAL passed away in early 2015, her former supervisor took over the case, and she was little better. The court discovered later that it was she (the supervisor) who illegally secured the case file and delivered it to the late VGAL in the first place.</p>
<p>VGAL system attorneys even advised the court’s own prosecutors in how to proceed against the parents in their termination of rights case.</p>
<p>And here’s the kicker: In Snohomish County, a little north of Seattle, the VGAL program “is an agency of the superior court.” So when the VGAL system took a stance against the parents and worked against reunification, the court through them became adversarial to the parents. When VGAL lawyers assisted prosecuting attorneys, they added to that adversarial nature without notifying the parents of those connections.</p>
<p>To make it worse, “employees of the VGAL Program, and therefore employees of the superior court, also engaged in retaliation against attorneys in the same firm as [the mother’s] attorney.”</p>
<p>
<strong>Imagine having all of these players working against you, to separate you from your child and end your rights as a parent. Now imagine they all work for the judge who’s hearing your case.</strong>
</p>
<p>It got so bad the judge actually recused herself. That is, she removed herself from the case because of the apparent conflict of interest.</p>
<p>But then she still entered the order to terminate the parents’ rights.</p>
<p>She made an order in the case, but afterwards she said she shouldn’t be in charge of the case</p>
<p>Finally, the parents’ lawyers appealed the whole mess, and the appeals court struck down the illegal actions of the lower court.</p>
<p>By now the baby is six years old.</p>
<h2>
<strong>The Appeal</strong>
</h2>
<p>
<strong>How can parents get a fair trial when the entire superior court is working against them to make sure they never see their baby again?</strong>
</p>
<p>The Appeals Court quoted from the original judge’s recusal memo that “[t]he Superior Court, its direct agents, and its own attorneys, all under the supervision of the judges repeatedly aligned with and <em>literally became a party litigating this case against the parents</em>…throughout the case.” (emphasis added)</p>
<p>Such conditions resulted in a violation of the parents’ rights to due process and the appearance of fairness, forcing the appeals court to reverse the termination order and demand a new trial.</p>
<p>But here’s the line that will make even experienced lawyers stop and read it again: “We remand for a new trial in a county <em>other than Snohomish County</em>” (emphasis added).</p>
<p>It’s bad enough when the appeals court tells the trial court, “You have to do it over because you messed up.” But in this case the abuses were so bad they declared instead (I’m paraphrasing here), “We don’t even trust you to do it over. The <em>parents</em> can’t possibly trust you to do it over.”</p>
<p>
<strong>“The parents get a do-over,” (I’m still paraphrasing the court), “but they will get it from<em> literally anybody else.”</em>
</strong>
</p>
<h2>It’s Not Just Here</h2>
<p>We know family courts like this don’t always play by the rules or produce just results. We know they often use “family privacy” as a “veil of secrecy” to hide their own unfair practices. But even in that dark world, this case stands out as especially egregious.</p>
<p>Yet it happened. And that means it may not be the only one. Who knows how many times Snohomish County courts operated like this before a family’s attorney decided to call them out? Who knows how many <em>other</em> courts have swept similar practices under the rug?</p>
<p>Sadly, some parents must lose their parental rights for the protection of their child. Still, every termination proceeding must be carried out with an attention to justice and fair play that matches the seriousness of the potential result.</p>
<p>
<strong>Termination of parental rights has often been called “the death sentence of the family court;” it must never be taken lightly.</strong>
</p>
<p>In our system of laws, even an unfit parent must be afforded their day in a fair and unbiased court. Anything less raises the specter of a system that steals children and gives them to favored parents looking for a child to adopt.</p>
<p>Our families—our <em>children</em>—deserve so much better than that.</p>
<p>Through the political voice of ParentalRights.org and the educational and policy voice of the Parental Rights Foundation, <strong>we strive to call attention to these abuses so more courts will respond as this appeals court has. We must demand, as the court did, that these wrongs <em>must be fixed</em>.</strong>
</p>
<p>Your gift today can help us continue this mission of sounding the alarm and demanding better for our families.</p>
<p>Thank you for standing with us to protect the rights of parents, in the interest of protecting the future of our children.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<![CDATA[<p>The hospitals of Britain are at it again. The “medical experts” have deduced that somehow “death” is actually in the best interests of Tafida Raqeeb, just as they decided for Alfie Evans in 2016 and Charlie Gard in 2017.</p>
<p>That’s like a car salesman telling you to just walk. Everywhere.</p>
<p>It’s like a kindergarten teacher telling children to just look at the pictures.</p>
<p>This is not what we are paying them for.</p>
<p>
<strong>To be clear, true medical experts are supposed to be about the business of <em>saving lives</em>.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://news.sky.com/story/tafida-raqeeb-mum-of-critically-ill-girl-begs-doctors-to-allow-treament-in-italy-11775545?">According to reports</a>, five-year-old Tafida suffered a traumatic brain injury in February arising from a rare, undiagnosed medical condition. A ‘tangle of blood vessels with abnormal connections between arteries and veins” resulted in a dramatic change in a single night. Tafida went from “a perfectly healthy, bubbly child” to being on life support.</p>
<p>There is hope. A hospital in Italy has offered to take over her treatment, just as in the case of Alfie Evans. But also similar to that case, <strong>the British hospital refuses to allow the little girl to be discharged.</strong>
</p>
<p>“They kept on saying if we want Tafida out, then ‘you need to take us to court, we are not going to release her’,” Tafida’s mother, Shalina Begum, told Sky News. “But they were not prepared to budge.”</p>
<p>So far the state-run hospital is two-for two in court, and they have two dead children to show for it. Now they are prepared to fight once again, in an effort—an <em>effort</em>—to make that <em>three </em>dead children.</p>
<p>To be clear, this is not yet happening in the United States. Though we have seen a disturbing rise in instances of states taking custody of children from fit parents simply because the mom or dad disagrees with a diagnosis or treatment plan, we have not seen hospitals actively fighting for the chance to watch a child die.</p>
<p>Yet.</p>
<p>
<strong>But this is exactly the kind of outcome one might expect when a child’s healthcare decisions are made by those with a primary interest in keeping costs low, rather than by those—parents—whose primary interest is in the life of their child.</strong>
</p>
<p>Tragically, there are cases where a child’s prognosis is without hope, and there are parents in those cases unable to let go. There is a process by which a doctor or state actor can petition a court to override that parent’s grief-laden, denial-driven decision.</p>
<p>But the weight in those cases is on the hospital or state actor to prove the parent is being unreasonable. The law begins with the presumption that parents are acting in their child’s best interest.</p>
<p>In Britain, that presumption has been turned upside down, and the law assumes the hospital is right. This forces stressed, grieving parents to do the heavy lifting of proving the doctor is wrong.</p>
<p>As a result, the children are losing. And it’s no game; <strong>it’s literally a matter of life and death.</strong>
</p>
<p>Cases like these demonstrate the importance of preserving parental rights in the United States and adding that protection into the very text of the Constitution.</p>
<p>
<strong>Only by safeguarding the traditional decision-making role of parents can we protect children like Charlie, Alfie, and now Tafida, from death at the hands of a calloused state.</strong>
</p>
<p>As the cost of healthcare becomes a bigger and bigger political football, so increases the need to make sure <em>the value of a child’s life is never weighed in dollars and cents</em>.</p>
<p>And you know who’s good at keeping that from happening, at keeping the child’s life and interests front-and-center?</p>
<p>Parents.</p>
<p>Parents will not just sit by and watch their child die because her care is “too expensive.” Parents will not give up when there are still viable options to be explored.</p>
<p>Loving parents will never say of a child with a future, “I simply think dying is in your best interest.” <strong>How can these doctors even stomach doing this to yet another child?</strong>
</p>
<p>Clearly, loving parents are much better equipped to represent their child’s interests than the British medical system, or even our own.</p>
<p>Please take a moment today to support the Parental Rights Foundation through a generous donation or by passing this email on to interested friends and family. Together we are working to educate America on the fact <strong>that discarding parental rights literally places children’s lives at risk.</strong>
</p>
<p>Thank you for standing with us to protect children by defending parents’ rights.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Michael Ramey</p>
<p>Executive Director</p>

<![CDATA[<p>If we can’t get through, we’ll go around.</p>
<p>That’s our plan for protecting parental rights relating to child welfare investigations. We won’t give up. We won’t quit.</p>
<p>
<strong>            Because if Congress won’t protect families, we’ll find another way.<br>
</strong>
</p>
<p>Right now we can’t afford not to. Not when a good parent can spend ten years or more on a child abuse registry even after the judge cleared her of all suspicion of abuse.</p>
<p>That’s what happened to Hope, a New York mom targeted for an abuse investigation by an anonymous phone call during a heated divorce.</p>
<p>There was never any abuse, never any reason for the call. Hope was quickly found innocent both in family and criminal court. But her name went on the register anyway, and <em>stayed there for ten years.<br>
</em>
</p>
<p>She was suspended from her job when this black mark showed up on her background check. She couldn’t pursue a dream of working with children, or even help with her daughter’s mentoring program.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for Hope and parents like her, the federal Child Abuse Prevention and  Treatment Act (or CAPTA), which created the hotline and registry systems in the first place, didn’t call for any “due process” protections before parents like her could be put on those lists.</p>
<p>
<strong>            That’s bad news for good, loving parents everywhere.</strong>
</p>
<p>So when we learned CAPTA was going to be up for reauthorization this year, making use of the opportunity to fix these problems became our top priority.</p>
<p>CAPTA works by providing much sought-after federal funding for state child welfare investigation agencies. In order to get those funds, every state will jump through the hoops CAPTA sets for them.</p>
<p>So we knew right away: if we can improve parental rights in CAPTA – changing the hoops they have to jump through – we can improve the way families are treated all over the country. We can keep other parents from suffering as Hope has.</p>
<p>
<strong>            Fixing this one act was the most efficient way to protect all our children. So, we went all-in.</strong>
</p>
<p>We didn’t just email, write, call, and visit members of Congress. We plugged in with family rights allies from across the political spectrum and asked them to go with us.</p>
<p>Whenever we visited a Democrat lawmaker’s office, we were sure to have an expert with us from the left side of the aisle. And every time we visited a Republican, we went with an expert from the right side of the aisle.</p>
<p>Whichever party we needed to talk to, we could almost <em>guarantee</em> they would meet with us.</p>
<p>Sadly, Congress proved (as they so often do) that <em>“meeting with us”</em> and <em>“hearing us” </em>are two different things. So when the House presented their version of the bill, our improvements hadn’t made the cut.</p>
<p>We weren’t pushing for anything crazy. We just shined a light on a few troubling matters that have had a clearly negative impact on child welfare outcomes through the years. We even presented reasonable solutions for those problems—<em>solutions our allies on both sides of the aisle agree with.</em>
</p>
<p>We pushed for an amendment to CAPTA that would protect a parent’s right to due process before their name is put on a child abuse registry. It was CAPTA that first required those registries, but its lack of a “due process” provision means parents in most states can be put on the list simply on the whim of the investigator assigned to their case.</p>
<p>This happened to Hope even after she was cleared of all charges in both criminal and family court!</p>
<p>
<strong>            If CAPTA had included our edit—or something like it— then Hope wouldn’t have spent ten years under the black mark of shame that comes from being falsely labelled a “child abuser.”</strong>
</p>
<p>CAPTA created that mess, so it’s the perfect vehicle to fix it. But the House apparently doesn’t think there’s a problem to be fixed.</p>
<p>We also pushed for an amendment to replace anonymous reporting with confidential reporting. With its call for the establishment of 24/7 anonymous child abuse hotlines, CAPTA created another problem: national statistics show that a shocking 96% of all anonymous reports are unreliable.</p>
<p>Just like the anonymous call that did so much to destroy Hope’s life for a decade.</p>
<p>Under CAPTA, every call must be investigated. That means for every <em>one </em>valid anonymous tip, <strong>
<em>twenty-four </em>
</strong>are wasting the agency’s time—<em>time that could be spent finding and helping victims of actual abuse.</em>
</p>
<p>We told Congress that by replacing anonymous reporting with confidential reporting we could empower the system to recognize and act on trends of abusing the system. If a jilted ex keeps calling in false reports to build his or her custody case, the agency can spot that behavior and report it to the courts. Innocent families could be saved.</p>
<p>
<strong>            But the House didn’t seem to think that was a problem, either. </strong>
</p>
<p>And we asked for the inclusion of a removal standard—a level of evidence or             expectation of imminent harm that must be met before a child can be removed from their family home without a court order.</p>
<p>As it is, innocent families are torn apart every day on the whim of a child welfare investigator with little or no evidence of abuse. And too many of these removals happen under “emergency circumstances,” with no prior review by a judge. A standard of removal would correct this error.</p>
<p>Sadly, while the members and staff we talked to all nodded in agreement and understood these concerns, they apparently didn’t understand them enough to be sure they were addressed in the reauthorization bill.</p>
<p>Still, we weren’t finished trying to make these crucial changes. And we aren’t giving up now, either. But we are looking at another option.</p>
<p>We’re not giving up, because there’s still a chance to fix CAPTA in the Senate.                 They could take any or all of our recommendations and insert them in their own version of the bill, then iron out the differences in “conference committee.” (That’s where members of the House and members of the Senate come together to create a version both chambers can agree on.)</p>
<p>But we’re not holding our breath on those efforts being any more successful in the Senate than in the House. With each chamber under the leadership of a different party, there are more closed-door politics than open, respectful discussions taking place on Capitol Hill.</p>
<p>With the House looking to make CAPTA worse, it may be all the Senate can do to be sure we break even.</p>
<p>If that proves true, none of these fixes will make it into CAPTA in any meaningful way.</p>
<p>
<strong>            No changes will be made and no families will be helped. </strong>
</p>
<p>But what if there is another way? Another way we could keep children from being needlessly harmed by invasive investigations?</p>
<p>Well, we think we’ve found one. It’s just going to take a lot more time and effort.</p>
<p>
<strong>            Since Congress won’t fix these issues in CAPTA for all fifty states, we’ll go to the states themselves.</strong>
</p>
<p>Instead of using CAPTA to help families by changing the hoops that every state has to jump through, we’ll make each state get a hoop.</p>
<p>It could be a while before we get all fifty. But we’ll start with a few right away and encourage the movement to grow.</p>
<p>On the matter of due process, for instance, a few states already have some minimal protection. CAPTA requires a registry, and it doesn’t require protections for innocent parents. But that hasn’t stopped North Carolina, Vermont, Idaho, and Connecticut from passing laws of their own to protect those rights.</p>
<p>Sadly, a recent review shows that only these four states currently provide any due process protection at all. And the protection these states offer varies from “lukewarm” to “scant.”</p>
<p>But the fact that they offer protection at all proves every other state can follow their example—and better—if they want to. We just have to get them started.</p>
<p>
<strong>            This may be a tough fight, and it’s going to constitute a significant shift in our immediate focus. </strong>We are certainly not giving up on the Parental Rights Amendment, but that is a long-term project that is going to require a kind of bipartisanship not to be found in D.C. today.</p>
<p>And we’re not giving up on securing parents’ rights through CAPTA, either.  <em>We will continue to fight its harmful content by visiting and educating Senators and their offices.</em>
</p>
<p>But both the Amendment and our recommendations to CAPTA are top-down goals. They would fix our country’s abuse of parental rights on the federal level. But they require Congress to act. And that means they will take time to achieve.</p>
<p>
<strong>            Addressing this in the states is a more immediately achievable, bottom-up fix. But we have to start now. </strong>
</p>
<p>If we wait to see what the Senate does with CAPTA, it will be too late. State lawmakers are deciding their agenda for January<em> right now. </em>If we wait and the Senate doesn’t come through, we will lose the entire 2020 legislative session.</p>
<p>And let’s face it; we’re just not likely to see these long-term improvements come from Congress this year.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we’re excited by what we can achieve with this focus on state efforts. Most of the fixes we wanted in CAPTA are still within reach by this new approach.</p>
<p>Each state can pass a high-bar removal standard and still be eligible for CAPTA funds. Each state can adopt due process protections before listing parents on their registry, without surrendering those federal grants. <strong>We can draft model language to accomplish that and give it to state lawmakers to run with.</strong>
</p>
<p>What’s more, last year’s Resolutionary campaign built our network in the states, while this year’s congressional efforts built relationships with new partners across the spectrum. These are huge points in our favor.</p>
<p>
<strong>            We’re ready to plunge forward into this fight.</strong>
</p>
<p>But it’s still going to take a lot of time, effort, and resources to succeed.</p>
<p>Will you partner with us to take on this new task? Your generous contribution will empower us to keep our presence in Congress<em> even as we take our fight for families to the states.</em>
</p>
<p>We can’t afford to stop now. Families like Hope’s are counting on us to secure the rights of innocent parents any way we can.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>James R. Mason</p>
<p>President</p>
<p>P.S. — The ideals we have for the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, including due process, a standard of removal, and other family-protecting measures, are still achievable in the states, even if Congress won’t “play ball.” <strong>And parents are counting on us to secure these rights and hold their families together. </strong>Children need the security these simple rights can provide. Please partner with us through your best gift today as we take this battle from Congress to the states!</p>

<![CDATA[<p>A Pennsylvania school district came under fire last week for a letter sent home to parents who owed debts for their child’s school lunch program. <strong>Unable to collect for the breakfasts and lunches certain students had consumed, the Wyoming Valley West School District threatened to have the families reported to “dependency court” and have their children taken away.</strong>
</p>
<p>“Your child has been sent to school every day without money and without a breakfast and/or lunch,” the letter charges, based on a photo taken from Facebook and shared in a <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/school-district-threatens-parents-their-children-could-be-placed-in-foster-care-for-unpaid-lunch-debts-182606606.html">
<em>Yahoo! Lifestyle</em> article</a>.</p>
<p>
<strong>“This is a failure to provide your child with proper nutrition and you can be sent to Dependency Court for neglecting your child’s right to food.</strong> If you are taken to Dependency court (sic), the result may be your child being removed from your home and placed in foster care.”</p>
<p>
<a href="https://holistickenko.com/online-nutritionist/">Proper nutrition</a> is extremely important to the health of your child. </p>
<p>According to reports, the average debt is $22.47 per child.</p>
<p>“I found it very disturbing. Upsetting,” Executive Director Joanne Van Saun of the county’s Children and Youth Services (DCFS) told Yahoo’s reporter. “It is a total misrepresentation, a gross misrepresentation of what our agency does.”</p>
<p>Additional comments quoted in that article demonstrate that the county’s DCFS has a much healthier view of its intended role in the community than the one presented by the school.</p>
<p>
<strong>Unfortunately, the school shows little remorse for the ill-conceived threat.</strong>
</p>
<p>“Hopefully, that gets their attention and it certainly did, didn’t it?” the school’s lawyer, Charles Coslett <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/pennsylvania/articles/2019-07-19/parents-told-they-could-lose-kids-over-unpaid-school-lunches">told <em>U.S. News and World Report</em>
</a>. “I mean, if you think about it, you’re here this morning because some parents cried foul because he or she doesn’t want to pay a debt attributed to feeding their kids. How shameful.”</p>
<p>
<strong>Shameful? Shameful is taking a system designed to be a last resort for child victims of abuse and weaponizing it to collect a simple monetary debt.</strong>
</p>
<p>“Give us our money or we’ll take your kids” sounds more like something from a Liam Neeson movie than from a public school.</p>
<p>And it’s a bad idea in the movies, at that.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the school has been forced to walk back its hollow threat and is expected to issue a new letter this week to apologize.</p>
<p>
<strong>Perhaps the saddest thing about this whole event (apart from the implication that your family is worth less than $25) is that the threat was available to the school in the first place.</strong>
</p>
<p>But school administrators, like some child welfare investigators, know the score.</p>
<p>They know that thanks to fifty years of mandatory reporting laws, the system is rigged to pay close attention to any report of neglect or abuse coming from a professional such as a doctor or your child’s school.</p>
<p>
<strong>They know it’s rigged to take children first and ask questions later.</strong> That’s partly because federal monies depend on the number of children in care, and partly because no investigator ever lost their job for taking a child from a healthy home unnecessarily.</p>
<p>And it’s certainly rigged because police and judges are trained to side with the agency first, and only return your children after you’ve been through “the process.”</p>
<p>This case in Pennsylvania will end well. Parents cried foul, the media sided with the families, and <em>even DCFS refused to defend the school’s actions</em>.</p>
<p>But that’s not always the case. <strong>Federal provisions like anonymous reporting, child abuse registries without due process, and the mandatory reporting laws mentioned above make it very hard for innocent families to protect their children.</strong>
</p>
<p>That’s why federal laws like CAPTA (the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act) need to change, and why we’re working hard to change them.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>This morning Tennessee attorney Connie Reguli turned herself in to the Brentwood, TN, police in response to news yesterday that a warrant had been issued for her arrest.</p>
<p>Reguli is founder of the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1697223540511940/">Family Forward Project</a>, an ally in the fight to protect parental rights and call attention to the need for family court reform. I had the privilege of meeting Connie at the State of the Children rally hosted by Families and Children’s Justice in Detroit last Fall.</p>
<p>
<strong>Today she stands accused of “facilitating custodial interference,” apparently only for her actions as a lawyer on behalf of her client in pushing back in family court.</strong>
</p>
<p>On Tuesday Reguli told a video blogger, “I have never broken the law, …never had a single criminal charge, and here we are, <strong>because I tried to get a parent due process, which means notice and opportunity to be heard.</strong> I am now going to be criminally charged for that.”</p>
<p>The mother has also been arrested on the same charge.</p>
<p>The situation arose from a DeKalb County child welfare investigation case for which Reguli was the mother’s legal representative. Reguli claims the arrest warrants are in retaliation for her recording conversations with investigators and case managers and pushing back against the agency’s “harassment” of her client.</p>
<p>The timing of the arrest, after the children have been returned and the original child abuse case against the mother dismissed, is likely because the case “is a civil rights lawsuit just waiting to happen” and “Tennessee has a very short statute of limitations,” Reguli suggests.</p>
<p>
<strong>Arresting a lawyer would seem to be a convenient way to keep her from filing her client’s lawsuit in time.</strong>
</p>
<p>Reguli takes issue with the county’s normative use of <em>ex parte</em> orders to seize children from their homes without first giving parents a hearing, or even notice of the accusations against them. An <em>ex parte</em> order is supposed to be an emergency measure employed to gain permission to remove a child where “there is imminent risk of irreparable harm before a hearing could be held,” explains Reguli.</p>
<p>Instead, they are used all the time in DeKalb, the only apparent purpose being to catch families at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>Perhaps because she is an attorney, Reguli received more courtesy than that. She got a phone call from a sheriff’s deputy on Tuesday and was allowed to make arrangements to turn herself in Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>Reguli was processed, then released on her own recognizance at 2:00 p.m. local time. <strong>We will continue to follow her story</strong> and keep you posted in future newsletters.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Michael Ramey</p>
<p>Executive Director</p>

<![CDATA[<p>This week a blog called “Rethinking Foster Care” <a href="https://rethinkingfostercare.blogspot.com/2019/07/branded-byhope-lyzette-newton.html">features a post</a> by Hope Lyzette Newton<strong>, a mom falsely accused of child abuse</strong> who spent the last ten-plus years on New York’s State Central Register (SCR).</p>
<p>Under the title “Branded,” Newton explains that for the entire time she was on the register, she felt like she wore “a brand on [her] chest—invisible perhaps, but searing, and [she] felt as though people could see it.”</p>
<p>By her account, <strong>Newton had done nothing wrong</strong>. She was the subject of a false report stemming from a bitter divorce. Cases against her in both child welfare and criminal courts were quickly dismissed. But <strong>her name on the registry has caused her years of anguish and shame.</strong>
</p>
<p>Her story is exactly the sort of tragedy we had in mind last winter when we began to approach lawmakers about making changes in the “<strong>Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act</strong>” to ensure due process for parents before they’re put on a registry like the SCR.</p>
<p>Too often, as in Newton’s case, a name is added to the list on the mere word of a child welfare investigator, with no court decision or conviction required. In some instances, a name is even added <em>contrary to</em> a court decision that finds a parent not guilty.</p>
<p>Newton’s name was probably added to the list before her cases were dismissed, but it could even have been added after the fact. There’s nothing in New York law to prevent it.</p>
<p>In her recent book, <em>They Took the Kids Last Night</em>, Chicago-area attorney Diane Redleaf shares just such an account, where the registry listing was added <em>four days after a court decision,</em> by a welfare investigator who <strong>simply refused to agree with the judge’s ruling.</strong>
</p>
<p>And that, as we told any congressman who would listen, is a<strong> problem.</strong>
</p>
<p>The Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution declare that no one “shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law,” a guarantee seemingly lost on many states with child abuse registers.</p>
<p>The child welfare system claims the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments don’t apply because parents aren’t being deprived of “life, liberty, or property.” But experiences like Newton’s prove otherwise.</p>
<p>These registries are often used in background checks that can prevent innocent parents from securing jobs in fields working with children—like nursing, teaching, and childcare—thus depriving them of a livelihood.</p>
<p>That was true for <strong>Hope Newton, who temporarily lost her job in admissions at a community college because her name was on the list</strong>. “My fingerprints came up ‘dirty,’” she says in the post.</p>
<p>Fortunately for Newton, her sixteen-year-old son pushed her to get her name expunged and a law group she was working with by then was able to help her navigate the treacherous waters to see that happen.</p>
<p>But too many innocent parents remain listed.</p>
<p>
<strong>This could all be fixed with the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, or CAPTA.</strong> CAPTA provides funding for any state that will agree to its federal guidelines on child welfare agencies. It is also the federal law that pushed states to create registries in the first place. So it would be fitting to insert due process protections in the bill as well.</p>
<p>And<strong> it would be a simple fix</strong>. Just <strong>require that to be eligible for federal dollars, a state must require due process protection for any parents before they are put on the registry,</strong> including a chance to defend one’s self in a fair hearing before an impartial adjudicatory body. And require states to provide a quick and accessible means to appeal.</p>
<p>Such a protection would have allowed Newton’s name to be expunged from the roll years ago.</p>
<p>Unfortunately,<strong> the House rejected our proposals to provide due process.</strong> And the Senate doesn’t look hopeful on that point, either. We haven’t given up. But we have found <strong>a new source of encouragement.</strong>
</p>
<p>A few states—tragically few—provide worthwhile protections of the sort we’d like to see. In the weeks ahead, we’ll be going over their laws and drafting model legislation we can introduce in additional states. If we can’t win from the top down, we’ll fight this battle in the states –<strong> from the bottom up.</strong>
</p>
<p>It will be a long road. CAPTA would be a simpler route to take, as it would fix all 50 states at once. But if Congress won’t play ball, we’ll take the matter to those who will.</p>
<p>What we won’t do is give up on the rights of innocent parents. So thank you for standing with us as we forge ahead to make Hope Newton’s story one of the last of its kind.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

</p>
<p>A new video from the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) reveals a fundamental problem with Child Protective Services (CPS).</p>
<p>
<strong>When CPS gets a call, their first move is to send an investigator to look around.</strong> This “first-responder” role is often portrayed as social work: a stranger stepping in to help needy families.</p>
<p>In reality, the investigator must observe the family and home around them, gathering evidence and separating possible abuse victims from potentially dangerous homes.</p>
<p>Social work— providing aid to the needy— is a far cry from this kind of evidence-based decision making, which is more closely in line with law enforcement.</p>
<p>More importantly, <strong>“social workers” often argue in court that as “service providers” they are not subject to the Fourth Amendment</strong>, which protects families from “unreasonable searches and seizures.” We have long argued that is not the case. They are investigators who must have a warrant based on probable cause before raiding a home or taking a child.</p>
<h3>
<strong>Good Ideas</strong>
</h3>
<p>Last week, AEI released a new video that highlights this problem with the child welfare system and encourages changes in how one sees the investigator’s role. And we couldn’t agree more with their suggestions.</p>
<p>
<strong>“To improve our child welfare system, we have to improve the recruitment of the people working in it,”</strong> says AEI Resident Fellow Naomi Schaeffer Riley in the one-minute video.</p>
<p>Far too often, agents are not equipped to investigate and must rely on personal bias and “gut” instinct instead. It’s damaging to families and can be heart-wrenching to those who thought they were getting into social work.</p>
<p>The video cites a national study showing a 30% turnover rate at CPS, with some agencies experiencing turnover rates as high as 65%. No wonder the employees leave so fast, if agencies are hiring the wrong people to begin with.</p>
<p>As a solution, Riley suggests, “We should consider recruiting applicants for CPS who are interested in law enforcement, not just social work.”</p>
<h3>
<strong>A Good Fit</strong>
</h3>
<p>Obviously, a carpenter will be miserable in a computer programming job, just as a computer programmer won’t like reroofing your house. But with both in the right place your roof won’t leak and your computer application will serve its intended purpose.</p>
<p>Having the right people in the job—people trained in investigations—will reduce the number of unnecessary removals. That’s because <strong>an investigator will follow a process of deduction and not break families apart without hard evidence.</strong>
</p>
<p>This highlights one reason we’re working in Congress right now to guide pending changes to the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act. This bill, which funds and determines how CPS works in the states, <em>must</em> include basic privacy protections for families and recognize these agents not as “warm fuzzy” service providers, but for the investigators they are.</p>
<p>
<strong>It’s a change that can save families.</strong>  Eliminating unnecessary trauma to children while lowering caseloads for investigators sounds like a win-win to me.</p>
<p>We are preparing to launch a major grassroots effort regarding CAPTA coming up in July, and it would be wonderful to add as many voices as possible to stand with us.</p>
<p>So watch the one-minute AEI video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DT9xi-UFes">here</a>, then share it with your family and friends. Urge them <strong>to <a href="https://parentalrights.org/get_involved/">sign up at ParentalRights.org</a> for more updates</strong> and to join our efforts to amend CAPTA and protect parental rights.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Last Thursday we had the honor of presenting a briefing on the matter of the CAPTA reauthorization to staffers from several Senate offices. (We have chosen not to identify the specific offices for politically strategic reasons.)</p>
<p>CAPTA is the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, a federal law that provides funding to the states if they meet certain standards relating to child abuse treatment and prevention. First passed in 1976, CAPTA has been due for reauthorization since 2015, and this spring both political parties are committed to getting that done.</p>
<p>Three weeks ago, a senior staff member from a Senate committee determined a briefing on the proposed changes to CAPTA could be helpful for himself and his colleagues, and <em>he thought of us.</em> <strong>So he asked ParentalRights.org and Home School Legal Defense Association to present to select, invitation-only Senate staffers a briefing on CAPTA.</strong>
</p>
<p>We were happy to seize the opportunity to express our concerns with CAPTA and share our ideas for improving the law to help families.</p>
<p>During the hour-long briefing, ParentalRights.org president Jim Mason had no trouble answering every question with a first-hand account from his own experience as a litigator.</p>
<p>From his years defending home schooling families on behalf of HSLDA, <strong>Jim has seen all the tricks and hurdles child welfare agencies sometimes employ to override the rights and wishes of fit and loving parents.</strong>
</p>
<p>While their base is limited to home schoolers, HSLDA has a history of representing families from the time a child investigator is on the doorstep all the way though court findings and even appeals, so Jim has seen hundreds of cases in his years there.</p>
<p>On the strength of Jim’s experience, we were able to present to those Senate offices many of the same concerns we have shared with you in this newsletter throughout the first half of this year, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>CAPTA encourages states to set up child abuse registries</strong> with little or no due process. It is too easy to get on a list and far too hard to get one’s name removed.</li>
<li>
<strong>Anonymous reporting leaves the child welfare system ripe for abuse</strong> by vindictive exes or other bad actors, who weaponize child welfare investigations for personal gain.</li>
<li>
<strong>CAPTA lacks a standard of removal</strong>, allowing children to be removed without a warrant and without a showing of imminent harm.</li>
<li>CAPTA fails to require states to <strong>differentiate between poverty and neglect</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We also warned against the suggestion coming from other quarters to insert a mention of “child abuse pediatricians” in the bill.</p>
<p>In our experience, this newly licensed field is used disproportionately to harm healthy, loving families by providing unscientific evidence of abuse under a veneer of medical expertise. Recognizing the “specialty” in federal law would serve to legitimize their claims and increase the damage they can cause in court.</p>
<p>The briefing was well-received by staff members of some key Senators and opened a door for future contact with those offices.</p>
<p>While we cannot claim to know the future, we are hopeful <strong>this is a good start toward keeping the Senate from adopting the version of CAPTA that came out of the House.</strong> That version incorporates none of our fixes but would leave these harmful problems intact. Worse, it would triple the funding for the next five years.</p>
<p>
<strong>And one thing worse than continuing decades of bad ideas is continuing decades of bad ideas at three times the current rate.</strong>
</p>
<p>We were humbled and excited to get this invitation, to be <em>the</em> organization, in partnership with HSLDA, to represent the family side of the CAPTA equation for these key Senate offices. And we got that opportunity thanks to you.</p>
<p>It is thanks to your generous support, whether <a href="http://parentalrights.org/donate">as a donor</a>, a volunteer, or part of our broad Congress-calling army, that we have earned the reputation we have on Capitol Hill—a reputation as <strong>an important voice for families in the halls of Congress</strong>.</p>
<p>So let me just take this opportunity to say, “Thank you,” and to encourage you with this exciting development.</p>
<p>Together we will be heard, and we will make a positive difference for America’s families!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<![CDATA[<p>So far 36 state legislatures have wrapped up their 2019 legislative sessions, with six more to adjourn by the end of the month. So, what has 2019 brought at the state level? And where do we stand in the remaining eight states?</p>
<p>To sum it up, we have seen a number of victories—mostly defeats of bad bills, but a couple of positive changes, too—but <strong>several challenges remain</strong>.</p>
<h3>
<strong>Bad Bills Died</strong>
</h3>
<p>Bills in several states would have <strong>removed the religious or philosophical exemptions</strong> regarding childhood vaccinations. Such exemptions are important in allowing parents to exercise the right of informed consent on behalf of their minor children.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb19-1312">HB 19-1312</a> in Colorado and <a href="https://olis.leg.state.or.us/liz/2015R1/Measures/Overview/HB3063">HB 3063</a> in Oregon died with the adjournment of their respective legislatures. (<a href="https://www.house.leg.state.mn.us/bills/billnum.asp?billnumber=hb%201520">HB 1520</a> in Minnesota is in a similar position, except the legislature can take it up again if called into special session later this year.)</p>
<p>Unfortunately, similar bills passed in Washington (<a href="https://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=1638&amp;Year=2019&amp;Initiative=false">HB 1638</a>) and Maine (<a href="http://legislature.maine.gov/LawMakerWeb/summary.asp?ID=280071798">LD 798</a>), over our efforts and objections.</p>
<p>But in other areas we saw key victories.</p>
<p>Nevada’s <a href="https://www.leg.state.nv.us/App/NELIS/REL/80th2019/Bill/6816/Overview">AB 430</a> would require <strong>home visits for the parents of every newborn</strong>. However, champions of familial privacy and parental rights forced lawmakers to amend the bill to remove that requirement. In its amended version, the bill authorizes a study of early childhood home visits by the Legislative Committee on Child Welfare and Juvenile Justice, but does not mandate that families participate.</p>
<p>Iowa’s <a href="https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation/BillBook?ga=88&amp;ba=HF272">HF 272</a> also sought in-home visits for the parents of new infants, but was killed in committee.</p>
<p>New York’s S <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2019/s298">298a</a> would require that <strong>all children born after January 1, 2008, receive the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine</strong>. That bill died in committee, too.</p>
<p>Finally, a Texas bill (<a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/BillStages.aspx?LegSess=86R&amp;Bill=HB575">HB 575</a>), which would have opened the door for more grandparents to sue fit parents for access to child visitation, failed to pass before the session adjourned. (We support the role of loving grandparents as an aid to or in the absence of fit parents, but where the parents are fit, their authority trumps that of other relatives. This bill would have put a strain on that parental role.)</p>
<h3>
<strong>Good Bills Also Died</strong>
</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, most of the positive bills put forth this year also died when the session ended.</p>
<p>Two separate <strong>“Parents’ Bill of Rights” efforts ran out of time</strong>, including <a href="https://www.myfloridahouse.gov/Sections/Bills/billsdetail.aspx?BillId=65928">HB 1171</a> in Florida and <a href="https://apps.legislature.ky.gov/lrcsearch#tabs-6">SB 152</a> in Kentucky.</p>
<p>Each of those states also introduced but failed to pass a resolution (Florida <a href="http://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2019/1726">SB 1726</a> and Kentucky<a href="https://apps.legislature.ky.gov/lrcsearch#tabs-6"> SCR 106</a>) that would call on Congress to pass the Parental Rights Amendment.</p>
<p>But the same kind of resolution was adopted in Oklahoma, whose House passed <a href="http://www.oklegislature.gov/BillInfo.aspx?Bill=SCR1&amp;Session=1900">SCR 1</a> on April 3. <strong>This makes Oklahoma the seventh state urging Congress to take this important step to protect parents’ rights permanently.</strong>
</p>
<h3>
<strong>Challenges Remain</strong>
</h3>
<p>While most of the country can therefore breathe a sigh of relief (at least most of the parental rights you had in January are still intact in June) there remain seven states with year-round legislatures and another—California—that adjourns in September.</p>
<p>And in those states, there are still some challenges to be faced.</p>
<p>First, <strong>Pennsylvania has a proposed Parental Rights Amendment resolution</strong> (<a href="https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billInfo/billInfo.cfm?sYear=2019&amp;sInd=0&amp;body=H&amp;type=B&amp;bn=0508">HB 508</a>) similar to the one passed in Oklahoma in April.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania also has two proposals that would support parental rights, including <a href="https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billInfo/billInfo.cfm?sYear=2019&amp;sInd=0&amp;body=H&amp;type=B&amp;bn=0286">HB 286</a> (to provide for informed consent related to vaccinations) and <a href="https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billInfo/billInfo.cfm?sYear=2019&amp;sInd=0&amp;body=H&amp;type=B&amp;bn=1022">HB 1022</a> (limiting the things child welfare agencies can call “neglect).</p>
<p>HB 1022 was referred to the House Committee on Children and Youth on April 2, and HB 508 (the resolution) was sent to the same committee a week later. HB 286 has been in the Committee on Health since January.</p>
<p>While the lack of movement on any of these may seem discouraging, plans on in the works to hold a rally this summer urging lawmakers to advance these measures in this session.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2019/proposals/reg/asm/bill/ab248">AB 248</a> in Wisconsin, which would <strong>remove religious or philosophical exemptions for vaccinations</strong>, was referred to the Committee and Constitution and Ethics upon its introduction on May 29. We will watch this bill closely as it threatens a parent’s right to make decisions for their child’s welfare.</p>
<p>And then there is <a href="http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200SB276">SB 276</a> in California, <strong>the most draconian proposal we have seen in the area of vaccinations.</strong>
</p>
<p>California passed a bill in 2014 (then <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160SB277">SB 277</a>) that removed all philosophical and religious exemptions for vaccines. Under SB277, evert child must be vaccinated before they can exercise their constitutionally-protected right to a public education, unless they receive a medical exemption.</p>
<p>But for some in the legislature, the government still doesn’t have enough control. So this year Senator Pan introduced SB 276, which would allow only medical exemptions approved by the State Department of Health. <strong>Even a parent and their child’s pediatrician together would not be worthy to make the best medical decision for the child.</strong>
</p>
<p>Since California’s legislature is in session until September 19, the battle over SB 276 will likely rage all summer. But as we have written to the legislature there, we remain committed to the right and ability of fit and loving parents to make the best medical decisions for their own individual children.</p>
<h3>
<strong>Stay Alert</strong>
</h3>
<p>So if you live in California or one of the seven states with year-round legislatures (Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin), stay alert for additional notifications whenever action may be needed to preserve parental rights.</p>
<p>Together we can be victorious in empowering parents, protecting children, and preserving families. Thank you for standing with us!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<strong>Betrayed.</strong>
</p>
<p>That’s how I felt when I read the House’s version of a bill to reauthorize <strong>CAPTA, the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act</strong>. It’s how we all felt.</p>
<p>And by “we all,” I mean our allies and coalition partners from all across the political spectrum. I mean partners I just met at the National Conference  on Child Abuse and Neglect a few weeks ago, and friends we’ve been working with for years.</p>
<h3>Betrayed by the House</h3>
<p>We felt betrayed, not simply because the House proposal will nearly triple the funding while preserving the same failed system that has been damaging families and traumatizing children for decades, but by how they did it.</p>
<p>You see, we gave them our opinion. We told them our concerns. We showed them how<strong> “business as usual” traumatizes five children for every one who actually needs help.</strong> We educated them on ways preventive measures can reduce child abuse instances without the need to invade families, least of all families where no abuse has occurred.</p>
<p>We gave them specific input, and even provided model language. And they thanked us.</p>
<p>They not only thanked us, but in certain instances they led us to believe we could count on them to take our concerns to heart.</p>
<p>And then <strong>they threw it all out the window for six more years of status quo.</strong>
</p>
<p>Well, that’s not entirely true. They didn’t throw it out the window. They threw most of it into a “study” provision of the bill, so we can spend the next six years funding studies to prove what we already know: <strong>preventive rather than reactive services make stronger families, healthier children, and more vibrant communities.</strong>
</p>
<p>Their purpose for including them was not because we need to study these things. The science is already there, the tools already tested and proved.</p>
<p>They included them in the study section specifically to quiet our concerns while <strong>buying six more years for the same failed system that is abusing children at far higher rates than our society at large.</strong>
</p>
<p>Fortunately, they alone do not get the last word.</p>
<h3>On to the Senate</h3>
<p>We expected from the start there could be contention between the House and the Senate on this bill because the House is ruled by the Democrats, who have the majority and exercise leadership there. In the same way, the Senate is governed by the Republicans.</p>
<p>As it turns out, though, we may have been wrong in our assessment. In the House, Democrats and Republicans came together to make radical, family-threatening changes at the last minute, and to keep out all the protective measures we had recommended over the last four months.</p>
<p>More than ever <strong>we need the Senate to oppose the House on these details. But that won’t just happen because of partisan politics.</strong> Both parties worked together to rob our families in the House version; they can do it again in the Senate.</p>
<p>That’s why <strong>last Thursday our president, Jim Mason, along with Maggie and me, went back to Capitol Hill to talk with key members of the Senate.</strong>
</p>
<p>We didn’t just talk to our friends, but rather targeted members of the specific Senate committee through which the bill must pass. Jim and Maggie were back in D.C. on Tuesday making even more of these strategic visits.</p>
<p>Sadly, we can’t make any promises on how that’s going to go. Every sign said the House was listening to our concerns and ready to turn the page to a new way of doing child abuse prevention. Then they betrayed our trust.</p>
<h3>It’s Up to Us</h3>
<p>
<strong>We can’t promise what the Senate will do, but we can promise you what we will do.</strong> We will continue to speak to Senators, and to members of the House as well, and urge them to promote child abuse prevention strategies that keep families together rather than tear them apart. We’ll urge decisions that <strong>protect as many children as possible from the trauma of an unwarranted government investigation.</strong>
</p>
<p>And we will stand for basic rights, like the right of due process for parents accused of abuse or neglect. Too often, parents are added to a “child abuse register” just because they disagreed with a child welfare investigator. Such registers should be reserved only for those parents found guilty in a court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
<p>The House version wants to not only keep those registers—without due process—but to link them together on a national scale.</p>
<p>
<strong>We will be back in D.C. as often as possible,</strong> talking to every Senator possible, to make sure the House’s nightmare version of CAPTA doesn’t see the proverbial light of day.</p>
<p>But <strong>we need you to partner with us.</strong> You can visit <a href="http://ParentalRights.org/donate">ParentalRights.org/donate</a> to support us as we shoulder the cost of these additional trips to D.C.</p>
<p>And please continue to <strong>watch our emails or social media pages for opportunities to call Congress.</strong> Once we’ve made these initial visits, we’ll be ready to make sure the Senate hears from as many of us as possible in favor of reasonable changes to CAPTA to protect both children and families.</p>
<p>
<strong>Thank you for standing with us,</strong> even when the government doesn’t. Your faithful support of families fuels us even on the days we feel betrayed. You give us the power to keep going.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Note: We were disappointed to see a recent opinion piece in which an admired legal professor claims the case law is settled, that parents have <em>no right</em> to make vaccine decisions for their children. We offered an opposing opinion to the <em>Sacramento Bee,</em> who published the original piece. They declined to print our opinion, so we’re sharing it with you here:</p>
<h2>
<strong>Parental Rights Case Law on Vaccines Is Not Settled</strong>
</h2>
<p>In his <a href="https://www.sacbee.com/opinion/california-forum/article229946704.html">
<em>Sacramento Bee</em> Op-ed of May 6</a>, Professor Erwin Chemerinsky posited that “[t]here is no constitutional right for parents to refuse to have their children vaccinated.” But the issue is not nearly as cut-and-dried as he would have readers believe.</p>
<h3>Two Lines of Cases</h3>
<p>The subject of parental rights in the face of mandatory vaccination is not settled in one single set of cases. Rather, <strong>two lines of cases must be considered: parental rights cases, and mandatory vaccination cases.</strong>
</p>
<p>In 2000, the U.S. Supreme Court recognized that “[t]he liberty interest…of parents in the care, custody, and control of their children is perhaps the oldest of the fundamental liberty interests recognized by this Court.” <em>Troxel v. Granville</em>, 530 U.S. 57 (2000), at 65. The Court cites a long list of cases covering a wide range of parental decision-making, dating back to 1923’s <em>Meyer v. Nebraska</em>.</p>
<p>By contrast, the Supreme Court case law on vaccine mandates underpinning Chemerinsky’s argument is sparse and outdated.&amp;nbsp; A Note in the <em>Harvard Law Review</em> from May 2008 asserts that <strong>“[b]iomedical advances are pushing the foundational public health law case <em>Jacobson v. Massachusetts</em> toward obsolescence.”</strong> Yet according to the Congressional Research Service (“Mandatory Vaccinations: Precedent and Current Laws,” May 21, 2014), the extent of significant case law involves <em>Jacobson v. Massachusetts</em> (1905) and <em>Zucht v. King</em> (1922).</p>
<p>In <em>Jacobson</em>, the Court held that the police power of the state includes authority to mandate a life-saving vaccine in the face of a deadly outbreak. “The state legislature proceeded upon the theory,” the Court summarized, “which recognized vaccination as at least an effective, if not the best, known way in which to meet and suppress the evils of a smallpox epidemic that imperiled an entire population.” The Supreme Court upheld the legislature’s decision.</p>
<p>This state power was extended by the <em>Zucht</em> decision to allow mandatory vaccination for public school attendance: “Long before this suit was instituted, <em>Jacobson v. Massachusetts</em> had settled that it is within the police power of a state to provide for compulsory vaccination.”</p>
<p>Like the opinion piece, neither case addresses the question of mandating vaccines for diseases, such as HPV, that <em>cannot</em> be spread through airborne particles. Sexually communicable diseases simply were not deliberated in <em>Jacobson v. Massachusetts</em>.</p>
<h3>Balancing Risks</h3>
<p>In addition, Chemerinsky claims “[p]arents do not have the right, no matter what their belief or religion, to put their children at risk of a communicable disease that is preventable and that sometimes has devastating consequences.” But this misstates the options.</p>
<p>Parents do not have a right to abuse or neglect a child; no one does. But vaccines have never been shown to be 100% safe or 100% effective. This is why vaccine package inserts are pages long and fraught with warnings. It is also why the Office of Special Masters of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, or “vaccine court,” has paid out $1.7 billion in vaccine injury claims since 2006.</p>
<p>
<strong>The vaccination decision involves balancing risks. </strong>And on the matter of parents balancing risks for their own children, the Supreme Court has already spoken.</p>
<p>“Simply because the decision of a parent is not agreeable to a child, or because it involves risks, does not automatically transfer the power to make that decision from the parents to some agency or office of the state.” <em>Parham v. J.R</em>., 442 U.S. 584 (1979), at 603.</p>
<p>Admittedly, the <em>Parham</em> case was not addressing vaccination decisions. Neither was <em>Jacobson v. Massachusetts</em> addressing vaccines for minor childhood diseases, sexually transmitted diseases, or non-communicable diseases. The vital point is that<strong> Supreme Court precedent exists <em>on both sides</em> to recognize that the balance between modern vaccine mandates and fundamental parental rights remains unsettled.</strong>

<![CDATA[<p>Dear Parental Rights Champion,</p>
<p>You know the power of a good idea. Or a bad one.</p>
<p>Corey Widen’s eight-year-old daughter had just returned from walking the dog around the block—most of which Corey could see from her windows—when there was a troubling knock at the door. It was the Wilmette (IL) police, responding to a call of a pre-schooler out unsupervised.</p>
<p>Corey cleared up the false information the police had gotten from an anonymous hotline call, and the police concluded their investigation: <em>no signs of abuse or neglect.</em>
</p>
<p>Corey was unsettled to find the police at her door, but it wasn’t a big deal once it was done.</p>
<p>
<strong>Then the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) showed up. </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>Yes,</em> they knew the police had already investigated. They<em> knew</em> the police found no evidence of abuse or neglect. But DCFS policy requires that they themselves investigate <em>every call</em> that comes in to the hotline.</p>
<p>And that’s a <strong>bad idea</strong>.</p>
<p>In Widen’s case, that involved entering the home, talking with the children, and interviewing the family’s neighbors and pediatrician. The full-scale investigation invaded the family for a period <em>not merely of hours</em>, <em>but of</em> <strong>
<em>weeks</em>
</strong>—and found no abuse, just like the police.</p>
<p>Sadly, this is how the system works in most of America today. And it’s funded by the federal government through the Child Abuse Prevent and Treatment Act (CAPTA).</p>
<p>So when the Civil Rights and Human Resources subcommittee of the U.S. House Education and Work Force Committee met recently to discuss CAPTA, which is due for renewal, we watched with bated breath.</p>
<p>Both political parties in D.C. had expressed a will to renew it this Spring.</p>
<p>But will the ideas they introduce help families, or hurt them?</p>
<p>Sometimes <strong>the only thing scarier than Democrats and Republicans clashing in Congress is when they don’t</strong>—and we know this could be one of those times.</p>
<p>Rumors were flying before the hearing about a few nightmare provisions that might be added. Provisions that would make child welfare programs <em>worse.</em> Provisions that would <em>violate innocent homes</em>. Provisions to target home schoolers or other minority-viewpoint families.</p>
<p>
<strong>We were on high alert.</strong>
</p>
<p>But we didn’t just wait to see what would happen.</p>
<p>Alongside a bipartisan group of family advocates, we took our positions to the members of the committee. We gave them a report in writing of the changes we would like to see—and some we would urge them to oppose.</p>
<p>We even asked our friends on the committee to look into getting our coalition a spot on the four-person witness list. We wanted to provide one of the voices that would define the hearing.</p>
<p>We didn’t get a spot this time, but it turns out <strong>we didn’t need to</strong>.</p>
<p>The hearing was held March 26, and <em>we were there</em>. Hanging on every word, we looked for the first clues on Congress’ goals in amending CAPTA.</p>
<p>
<strong>We were pleasantly surprised</strong>.</p>
<p>Though the speakers came from opposing sides of the aisle<em>, all four agreed</em>—and agreed with us—on some critical issues.</p>
<ul>
<li>They agreed prevention is better than intervention, that efforts to <em>support</em> families are more cost-effective than efforts that <em>divide</em>
</li>
<li>They acknowledged that separating families causes trauma to children.</li>
<li>They noted in crystal clear terms that “poverty” does not equal “neglect.”</li>
</ul>
<p>And the members of the committee seemed to agree with them<em>.</em> It was refreshing to see.</p>
<p>When we checked back with our friends on the committee, they confirmed what we were beginning to suspect:</p>
<p>
<strong>Our report had been instrumental in calling attention to certain important parental rights issues, and in swaying members to address them.</strong>
</p>
<p>The impact of that report is no small thing. Without your consistent partnership over the years, our report would not have gotten so far. Your support gave weight to our report and ensured that our concerns were heard.</p>
<p>
<strong>It</strong>
<strong> was a great day. </strong>
</p>
<p>But it was only one day.</p>
<p>Those rumors that had been flying around? <em>Those came from somewhere.</em>
</p>
<p>Somewhere, someone really was promoting ideas to <em>threaten your parental rights, your family</em>. Someone has suggested a special section of CAPTA just to address home schoolers. Someone else—or likely several “someones”—proposed “predictive analytics,” to target certain families because they meet a “profile” that may indicate abuse is coming <em>(though no abuse has occurred</em>).</p>
<p>Still others are encouraging Congress to spend more money on the same bad ideas that are destroying innocent families, supporting the system that invaded Corey Widen’s family for weeks because she let her daughter walk the dog. The over-worked system that keeps missing the children who really need help.</p>
<p>We don’t know specific names or proposed language. <strong>But we know the threats are there.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>And we know from experience that the threats whispered about in this round will be argued in the next, and maybe adopted in the one after that.</strong>
</p>
<p>The only way to stop bad ideas once they’re introduced into the discussion is to pass better ideas in their place. So that’s what we’re trying to do. While Congress is united to address CAPTA, <em>we need to persuade them to make changes for the good.</em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>But it won’t be easy.</strong>
</p>
<p>One bad idea already made its way into the hearing—the concept of a national child abuse registry.</p>
<p>It wasn’t put into so many words. And it sounded so reasonable. Surely it would help if one state could know whether a family was under investigation or even substantiated for a previous case of abuse in another state. <em>Right?</em>
</p>
<p>But child abuse registries are<em> not that simple</em>.</p>
<p>The biggest problem is what it takes to get on one (or what it <em>doesn’t</em> take). <strong>If a child welfare investigator decides you are guilty of abuse, they can list you on the registry. No charges. No trial. No ruling by the court.</strong>
</p>
<p>In fact, in her new book <em>They Took the Kids Last Night</em>, Diane Redleaf relates one case in which the judge determined the child abuse accusation was unfounded—and <em>still</em> the parents were listed on the registry.</p>
<p>Each parent had a career potentially working with children. One was in insurance, the other a trained social worker. What would happen when a potential new employer ran a background check and found them on the registry for child abusers?</p>
<p>
<strong>Imagine if you lost your job because someone decided – contrary to the decision of a judge – that you were guilty of abuse.</strong> Your whole life affected because one investigator decided they don’t like you.</p>
<p>Fortunately for that couple, their current employers knew what was going on, and neither of them had to change jobs during the process. But what a process it was!</p>
<p>It took the parents a costly months-long appeal to get their names removed. By then, though they managed to avoid the destruction of their careers, their reputations had still been irreparably harmed. Think of how much worse the harm would be if that registry had been <em>national</em> rather than just <em>in their state</em>!</p>
<p>Fortunately, no one pushed the national registry idea too loudly in the CAPTA hearing. There was just a mention that states need to be better able to communicate with each other.</p>
<p>But it is something we will keep an eye on. It’s an idea that can put innocent parents at risk.</p>
<p>
<strong>It’s an idea that can put <em>your family and mine</em> at risk.</strong>
</p>
<p>Fortunately, thanks to your generous past support, <em>we were able to be there</em>. We were able to listen, to bear witness, to monitor, and to respond.</p>
<p>And we were able to make our concerns and preferences known going in, with a voice that the committee respected and chose to hear.</p>
<p>The difference we have made so far is all because of <strong>
<em>you</em>
</strong>. <strong>You have enabled us to move forward.</strong>
</p>
<p>But we’re a long way from finished.</p>
<p>Though the subcommittee had a hearing, CAPTA hasn’t been renewed yet. There are a lot of steps that need to happen first, including multiple hearings, debates, and votes.</p>
<p>And every step creates an opportunity for some of those dangerous ideas to creep in, as well.</p>
<p>
<strong>The Democrats and Republicans are unified on passing CAPTA. So, if bad ideas squeeze their way in, there will be no one left to stop them.</strong>
</p>
<p>That is what we’re standing guard against.</p>
<p>
<strong>The force of both parties working together makes this a crucial time, for good or for bad. There is so much at stake.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<strong>W</strong>
</em>
<em style="font-weight: bold;">ill you stand guard with us?</em> Your donation of $25, $50, or $100 can enable us to protect families from potentially dangerous ideas in this key federal legislation.</p>
<p>
<em>We have to be vigilant</em>. We have to be both proactive and responsive.</p>
<p>We have to be the eyes, ears, and mouthpiece for innocent American families.</p>
<p>We have to make sure the new law makes experiences like Corey’s <em>rarer</em>—or even unheard of—and <em>not more commonplace</em>.</p>
<p>
<strong>With your help, we will do just that.</strong>
</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>James R. Mason</p>
<p>President</p>
<p>P.S. Families like Corey’s have already suffered because CAPTA has created a system that fails to respect their rights. And while the first hearing has passed, there is still so much work to do. <strong>Every step in the legislative process is another chance for enemies of your family to include bad ideas in the reauthorization bill.</strong>
</p>
<p>But we are banding together—with parents and with other organizations—to ensure that children no longer suffer because their parents’ rights have been ignored. <strong>Will you be part of their defense?</strong> [First Name], will you stand with us to protect our families from even more abuses at the hands of Child Welfare? The time has come to mend the broken system—<strong>for all of us.</strong>

<![CDATA[<p>Senate Bill 276 in California is scheduled for a hearing in the Senate Health Committee <strong>this Wednesday, April 24, at 1:30 pm</strong> in Room 4203 of the State Capitol. A rally in opposition to the bill has been scheduled to follow the hearing.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
<a href="http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200SB276" target="_new">Senate Bill 276</a> in California is designed to <strong>greatly reduce the number of families who can take a medical exemption to vaccine mandates.</strong> Since Senator Pan’s SB 277 passed in 2014, medical exemptions are the only form of exemption left to California parents who want to place their children in schools but are concerned by the warnings and possible side effects that accompany all vaccines.</p>
<p>In its original version, SB 276 would remove from medical providers the authority to issue a medical exemption; only the State Department of Health could issue an exemption.</p>
<p>In its currently amended form, the bill allows medical providers to submit a state-approved form as a means to file for a medical exemption, but<strong> it still falls exclusively to the Department of Health to approve or deny every application.</strong>
</p>
<p>ParentalRights.org strongly opposes SB 276, and has laid out reasons for our opposition in a letter addressed to the California legislature and <a href="https://parentalrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2019-CA-SB276-Oppose.pdf" target="_new">available online here</a>.</p>
<p>As we point out in the letter, declaring the exemption to be the exclusive purview of the Health Department sends a vote of “no confidence” against every medical professional duly licensed by the State.</p>
<p>The licensing board has deemed these professionals capable of practicing medicine, including diagnosing illness, prescribing forms of treatment, and even performing necessary surgery. But <strong>now the state says these same doctors cannot be trusted to know, in concert with concerned parents, what is the best medical care for their individual patients.</strong>
</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that these patients have likely seen their doctors countless times, and their pediatricians know their health history. The decision-makers at the Health Department will not know one child from another.</p>
<p>Ultimately, <strong>ParentalRights.org opposes SB 276 as a violation against the right of parents to make informed medical decisions for their own children.</strong> The idea that not even doctors, but only the State itself can make these decisions for your child is troubling in the extreme.</p>
<h2>Action Items</h2>
<ol>
<li>If you are able, <strong>plan to attend the hearing and the rally to follow.</strong> The hearing is in Room 4203 of the Capitol and the rally will be on the Capitol’s west steps. Those with a Facebook account can find more information at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/316742062289731/" target="_new">https://www.facebook.com/events/316742062289731/</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember that many who receive this email will not be able to attend, so if you can, please do so to represent all of those who cannot.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<strong>Contact your state senator</strong>, especially if they are on the Heath Committee, and urge them to vote against this dangerous legislation. Find their contact information <a href="http://www.legislature.ca.gov/your_legislator.html" target="_new">here.</a>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The scheduled rally is not an event of ParentalRights.org, but we are grateful to stand with those who are organizing this opposition to a bill that threatens your children by removing your parental right to protect them.</p>
<p>Thank you for standing with us this Wednesday!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Michael Ramey</p>
<p>Executive Director</p>

<![CDATA[<p>This legislative season has been something of a mixed bag, with some victories, some disappointments, some challenges, and one particular story that took us by surprise.</p>
<h2>
<strong>Some Victories</strong>
</h2>
<p>In <strong>Oklahoma</strong>, the Parental Rights Amendment (PRA) resolution, <a href="http://www.oklegislature.gov/BillInfo.aspx?Bill=SCR1&amp;Session=1900">SCR 1</a>, passed the House of Representatives by unanimous consent on April 3, <strong>making Oklahoma the seventh state to urge Congress to take up the PRA.</strong> The resolution already passed the Oklahoma Senate on February 13.</p>
<p>In <strong>Nevada</strong>, <a href="https://www.leg.state.nv.us/App/NELIS/REL/80th2019/Bill/6816/Overview">AB 430</a> would require home visits for any family of a newborn determined by the Divisions of Child and Family Services to be “at risk,” the definition of which includes “any other risk factor identified by the Division.”</p>
<p>Fortunately, we and several allied organizations were able to sound the alarm, and<strong> Nevada</strong> residents responded. Their outcry resulted in an amendment to the bill that will make sure these visits are voluntary and not mandatory. (We are still wary of the bill and will continue to watch it closely, but this change is a significant victory.)</p>
<p>Another <strong>Nevada</strong> bill, <a href="https://www.leg.state.nv.us/App/NELIS/REL/80th2019/Bill/6546/Overview">AB 295</a>, would require comprehensive sex education in public schools and replace the current opt-in requirement with an opt-out, allowing schools to include any child if they don’t hear an affirmative refusal from the parent. But the outcry against that bill was sufficient to keep it from going anywhere–another win.</p>
<h3>
<strong>Breaking News from Florida</strong>
</h3>
<p>In<strong> Florida</strong>, the Parents’ Bill of Rights (<a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2019/01171">HB 1171</a>) was unanimously approved by the House Education Committee on March 21. <strong>BREAKING:</strong> HB 1171 just passed the House Health and Human Services Committee today (April 16) in a 2 p.m. hearing. The bill still has one more committee and a floor vote to make its way through the House, but this is an exciting start.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, its companion in the Senate, <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2019/01726">SB 1726</a>, passed the Senate Education Committee on April 10 by a 5-3 vote. SB 1726 still faces two more committees and a floor vote, and the legislative session is scheduled to end in less than three weeks.</p>
<p>In short, the Parents’ Bill of Rights has a long way to go and a short time to get there, but it remains alive in both chambers of the Florida legislature.</p>
<h2>
<strong>Some Disappointments</strong>
</h2>
<p>In <strong>Kentucky</strong>, unfortunately, that is not the case. Both the Parents’ Bill of Rights (SB152) and a Parental Rights Amendment resolution (SCR 106) failed to pass the <a href="https://apps.legislature.ky.gov/lrcsearch#tabs-6">Kentucky legislature</a> before it adjourned for the year.</p>
<p>While disappointing, this year’s attempt has brought allies together and hopefully paved the way for success in the future. We appreciate so much the work of Senator Steve West and several of our organizational allies in championing these measures, and we look forward to working with them again in 2020.</p>
<h2>
<strong>Some Challenges</strong>
</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, efforts are still underway in <strong>Pennsylvania</strong>, whose legislature meets year-round. <a href="https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billInfo/billInfo.cfm?sYear=2019&amp;sInd=0&amp;body=H&amp;type=B&amp;bn=1022">HB 1022</a>, led by Rep. Kortz (D-38), takes pieces of last year’s Utah law protecting parents’ decisions regarding child supervision. This will allow for training children to grow in independence without threatening parents with charges of neglect.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania Rep. Cox (R-129) plans to introduce another bill soon that will preserve parental rights with “strict judicial scrutiny” in the courts. Obviously, we support both of these bills.</p>
<p>We are also facing some negative challenges, including bills across the nation to rob parents of the right to make informed medical decisions for their children. Bills to remove religious or philosophical vaccine exemptions include <strong>Iowa’s</strong> <a href="https://legiscan.com/IA/bill/HF206/2019">HF 206</a> and <strong>Oregon’s</strong> <a href="https://olis.leg.state.or.us/liz/2019R1/Measures/Overview/HB3063">HB 3063</a>.</p>
<p>
<strong>Iowa’s</strong> <a href="https://www.legis.iowa.gov/docs/publications/LGI/88/attachments/HF272.html">HF 272</a> would require home visits for any family who chooses to home school. (A similar bill proposed in Illinois was quickly defeated by public outcry.)</p>
<p>Obviously, all of these bills threaten children by threatening parental rights. Sadly, they are only a sampling of the many bad bills out there this spring.</p>
<p>One particularly heinous bill, <strong>California’s</strong> <a href="http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200SB276">SB 276</a>, would limit medical exemptions so that not even doctors licensed by the state, but only the actual state department of health, can authorize medical exemptions for vaccines. (California has already outlawed every other kind of exemption.)</p>
<p>
<em>Giving the State unchallenged control over your child’s health decisions? Over the objections of not only parents but even their doctors, too?</em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>It is difficult to see how this idea is even American.</strong> It threatens parental rights, medical rights, and most of all, our children.</p>
<p>Fortunately, even vaccine mandate proponents in the legislature are shying away from this one. But we will be watching it closely, and <strong>urge California residents to contact your lawmakers and make your opposition known.</strong>
</p>
<h2>
<strong>A Big Surprise</strong>
</h2>
<p>But then there’s <strong>Indiana</strong>.</p>
<p>When our call went out for Resolutionaries last August, we were pleasantly surprised by the response from Indiana, a state where we’ve had no real activity in the past. Then our U.S. House sponsor on the PRA lost his reelection bid in November and we found a new champion in Rep. Jim Banks—from Indiana.</p>
<p>Then the session started, and our (new) volunteers began in earnest to pitch the parental rights resolution to legislators.</p>
<p>We found a few interested parties, but it was looking like next year would be the earliest we could hope to make any progress. We found ourselves late in a session that only lasts through April.</p>
<h3>
<strong>Then in late March we had one remarkable week.</strong>
</h3>
<p>On Monday, we had nothing. One volunteer had scheduled a meeting with three or four lawmakers, including state Senator Dennis Kruse, that Tuesday. Her hope was to introduce the idea of a 2020 resolution, since it was already so late in the current session.</p>
<p>With others, the volunteer had also arranged for Rep. Banks to speak at a state home school convention that Saturday.</p>
<p>But Sen. Kruse looked over the resolution proposal and asked,<strong> “Why don’t we have something going right now?”</strong> His colleagues readily agreed.</p>
<p>For a couple of days, there was even hope Rep. Banks would be able to announce the resolution’s introduction to the convention that very week.</p>
<p>The resolution didn’t move quite <em>that</em> fast, but it was certainly moving. Senate Resolution 63 (<a href="http://iga.in.gov/legislative/2019/resolutions/senate/simple/63">SR63</a>) was introduced in the Senate on April 1 and referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.</p>
<p>SR 63 only has until April 29 to make it through both houses, so it remains a long shot for this year. But <strong>we went from “nothing on our radar” to drafted and introduced in under two weeks.</strong> It suddenly felt like anything was possible.</p>
<p>Especially, for some reason, in Indiana.</p>
<p>Thank you for standing with us. Not only your<a href="http://parentalrights.org/donate"> financial support</a>, but <strong>your alerting us to these bills and taking appropriate concerted action in your state makes all of these victories possible.</strong>
</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<![CDATA[<p>The Second Annual Maryanne Godboldo Forum for Parental Rights will be held at the <strong>Hartford Memorial Baptist Church</strong> located at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/18700+James+Couzens+Fwy,+Detroit,+MI+48235/@42.4286688,-83.1855524,17z">18700 James Couzens Highway in Detroit, Michigan</a>. The event is scheduled for <strong>Saturday, April 27, from 8 am to 3 pm</strong>.</p>
<p>
<strong>Maryanne Godboldo is the Detroit-area mother who faced a SWAT team</strong> through a 10-hour stand-off in 2011 when child services came to seize her daughter over a medical disagreement. Though her daughter was taken that day, Godboldo was eventually exonerated and the family reunited. Godboldo died of a brain aneurism in 2017, and her sister started this forum last year in her memory.</p>
<p>The conference is an opportunity for parents to learn valuable information about their rights, and will help parents make informed choices to preserve their children’s medical, educational, and spiritual wellbeing. <strong>ParentalRights.org board member and Detroit area family and defense attorney Allison Folmar will be a featured speaker at the event.</strong>
</p>
<p>Come out to hear from leading experts on parental rights and join the discussion on this critical issue. Be sure to say “Hi” to Attorney Folmar while you’re there. <strong>To RSVP</strong> or find out more information, please call 313.717.0521 or visit <a href="http://justice4maryanne.org">justice4maryanne.org</a>.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Dear Parental Rights Champion,</p>
<p>Your immediate action is needed to protect parental rights in Nevada. Two bills that threaten your family are currently making their way through the Nevada legislature and need to be stopped.</p>
<h2>
<strong>Background</strong>
</h2>
<h3>
<strong>Nevada Assembly Bill 430</strong>
</h3>
<p>
<a href="https://www.leg.state.nv.us/App/NELIS/REL/80th2019/Bill/6816/Text">AB 430</a> calls for a “family home visitation system,” which would <strong>require a state investigator or other child welfare employee to visit the home of every “at-risk” newborn child.</strong> Characteristics that would label a family as “at-risk” include, among others, “parents who are less than 20 years of age,” “parents who have reduced cognitive functioning or a significant disability,” “insufficient financial resources to meet the needs of the family,” and “any other risk factor identified by the Division.”</p>
<p>AB 430 is discriminatory, insulting, and unfair. It blatantly discriminates on the basis of age, disability, and poverty, while <strong>“any other risk factor” serves as a “fill-in-the-blank” opportunity for the Division to make its way into <em>any home they choose</em>.</strong>
</p>
<p>The bill would also place too great a demand on a system that is already overworked, to the detriment of children in actual need of intervention. Now these investigators, who already can’t handle their caseloads, will have to schedule home visits for every infant as well? That is not a good idea.</p>
<p>Further, opening this sort of investigation into every “at-risk” home, without any showing or claim of abuse or neglect, violates the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The bill ostensibly provides a “voluntary service,” but the one performing that service will in every instance be a “mandatory reporter,” required to report back to the child welfare agency anything they see in the home that suggests to them abuse, neglect, or other wrong-doing.</p>
<h3>
<strong>Nevada Assembly Bill 156</strong>
</h3>
<p>
<a href="https://www.leg.state.nv.us/App/NELIS/REL/80th2019/Bill/6242/Text">AB 156</a> would require the court, in any case where a child is alleged to be in need of protection, to <strong>“appoint an educational decision maker for the child.”</strong> While it establishes a rebuttable presumption that the decision maker would be the child’s parent, the presumption can be overcome by a simple showing that “it is not in the best interests of the child” (in the court’s opinion) “for the parent or legal guardian to act as the educational decision maker for the child.”</p>
<p>This could be interpreted to replace the correct rebuttable presumption, which is that a fit parent <em>does</em> act in the best interests of their child. <strong>The court’s opinion of what is “in the best interests of the child” should not come into play without a showing first that the parents are unfit</strong> (that is, abusive or negligent).</p>
<p>AB 156 could do away with this appropriate presumption which favors parents.</p>
<p>A second troubling section of the bill would instruct the “educational decision maker” to “ensure that the child receives a free and appropriate education in accordance with federal and state law.”</p>
<p>A literal, plain-meaning reading of this provision <strong>would render any alternative to public schools unacceptable.</strong> There are costs involved in home schooling, and private school costs even more. Neither could conceivably qualify as a “<em>free</em> and appropriate education.”</p>
<p>Frankly, we fail to see the point of AB 156, unless it is to pave the way for someone else to override the wishes of fit parents in how their children should be educated.</p>
<h2>
<strong>Action Items</strong>
</h2>
<p>1) <strong>Leave comments on the </strong>
<a href="https://www.leg.state.nv.us/App/Opinions/80th2019/">
<strong>legislation comment page</strong>
</a>. Use the simple online form to let lawmakers know you oppose AB 430 and AB 156. Lawmakers read these comments; if we can get enough opposition posted on the page, we can kill both bills before they go anywhere.</p>
<p>2) <strong>Contact your (state) assemblyman.</strong> <a href="http://mapserve1.leg.state.nv.us/whoRU/">Call their office</a> and urge them directly to oppose AB 430 and AB 156 as violations of your family and your parental rights. Tell them it is an affront to suggest the government can make better decisions for your child than you can.</p>
<p>Thank you for standing with us to protect children by empowering parents in Nevada!</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Just this afternoon we received word from the floor of the Oklahoma House of Representatives: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/FollowSCR1">Senate Concurrent Resolution 1</a> (SCR 1) passed the House by unanimous consent!</p>
<p>
<strong>This makes Oklahoma the seventh state to pass a resolution calling on Congress to pass the Parental Rights Amendment to the states for ratification.</strong>
</p>
<p>SCR 1 passed the Senate on February 13, so today’s passage in the House was the final step in its adoption by the state. Resolutions do not require the governor’s signature.</p>
<p>In the resolution, the Oklahoma legislature, on behalf of the people of the state, urge Congress, and especially Oklahoma’s delegation, to support the proposed PRA so the States can vote to add it to the U.S. Constitution.</p>
<p>The proposed Amendment would ensure,<strong> “The liberty of parents to direct the upbringing, education, and care of their child is a fundamental right.”</strong>
</p>
<h2>Many Thanks</h2>
<p>We are grateful to our volunteer leaders in Oklahoma who coordinated efforts there and kept us informed of the resolution’s progress. We especially salute Tracey Montgomery and Allison Ruggs for their efforts in making this victory possible.</p>
<p>We are also grateful to all of you for standing with us and supporting the effort all over the country. <strong>Together we continue the march forward to protect families by preserving parental rights in the text of the Constitution.</strong>
</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<u>Parental Rights Oklahoma</u>
</a> urges you to take action right now to protect your parental rights.</p>
<p>THIS Wednesday afternoon <a href="https://tinyurl.com/FollowSCR1">
<u>SCR1</u>
</a>, Oklahoma’s resolution to support the Parental Rights Amendment, will be heard on the floor of the Oklahoma House of Representatives. We need to let our representatives know to support this resolution, and we want to pack the gallery for the vote, as well.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>It is absolutely crucial that we no longer watch from the sidelines and that we stand up and take action!</p>
<p>It is painfully apparent that a steady erosion of support for parental rights has been gaining momentum, leaving the child-parent relationship vulnerable and exposed to the eminent danger of government intrusion. Supreme Court rulings and current news headlines show us how at-risk our parental rights are now, perhaps more than ever.</p>
<p>It’s time to install protection of parental rights into the US Constitution.</p>
<p>Oklahoma could be the seventh state to pass a resolution to support the historic Parental Rights Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which will further safeguard our children, our families, and our freedom.</p>
<h2>Action Items</h2>
<p>1) If you are able, <strong>plan to attend the session on Wednesday, April 3</strong>, at the State Capitol. Remember that many cannot attend due to work or school, so if you have the chance, please go on behalf of those who cannot.</p>
<p>Parental Rights Oklahoma will gather in the <strong>House gallery lobby on the 5<sup>th</sup> floor at 1:00</strong>. If you plan to attend, contact us at <a href="mailto:parentalrightsok@gmail.com">parentalrightsok@gmail.com</a> to let us know you’ll be there.</p>
<p>2) <a href="https://tinyurl.com/MyOKlegislator">
<strong>
<u>Call or email your representative</u>
</strong>
</a>, whether you can attend the vote or not, and urge them to support SCR1.</p>
<p>Simply explain that you expect them to act in favor of protecting your family, your freedom, and your parental rights. If you will be attending, tell them you will be at the Capitol on Wednesday at 1:00, watching from the gallery to see how they vote. (If you can’t attend, you might still mention that other parents will be there with Parental Rights Oklahoma to witness how they vote.)</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Hello!</p>
<p>The proposed Florida Parents’ Bill of Rights has just passed a major roadblock in the Senate. But we need your help today to keep it moving forward.</p>
<h2>
<u>Background</u>
</h2>
<p>Four weeks ago the “Parents’ Bill of Rights” was introduced as  <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2019/1171/BillText/Filed/PDF">HB 1171</a> in the House and <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2019/1726/BillText/Filed/HTML">SB 1726</a> in the Senate. Parentalrights.org staff and volunteers, led by state coordinators Jim and Patti Sullivan, have worked hard to get these bills introduced, and it is a major victory to get this far.</p>
<p>What’s more, we just learned the bill has been put on the agenda of the Senate Education Committee in week six (week of April 8). This is a major break-through. Any bill not on an agenda in the next few days would be dead for this session.</p>
<p>We squeaked in under the wire, but we need to make our voices heard now.</p>
<p>
<strong>Senate President Galvano, Senate Majority Leader Passidomo, and Education Committee Chair Senator Manny Diaz need to hear from you.</strong> They have the power to support SB 1726, or to block it from being brought up in the other two Senate committees it needs to pass. And of course it needs to pass the Education Committee as well.</p>
<h2>
<u>Action Item</u>
</h2>
<p>Call or email Senate President Galvano, Senator Majority Leader Passidomo, and Education Chair Senator Manny Diaz today. Thank them for putting SB 1726 on the week six agenda,  and urge them to support the bill. They wield a tremendous influence, and have the power to see this bill pushed or ignored. You can also reach out to the members of the Senate Education Committee and request they support  the bill.</p>
<p>
<strong>The first hearing is only days away. Please contact them now!</strong>
</p>
<p>President Galvano: (850) 487-5229; Email him <a href="http://flsenate.gov/Offices/President">here</a>.</p>
<p>Majority Leader Passidomo: (850) 487-5028; Email her  <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Senators/Districts">here</a>.</p>
<p>Education Chair Senator Manny Diaz Jr.: (850) 487-5036; Email him <a href="http://flsenate.gov/Senators/S36">here</a>.</p>
<p>Contact the whole Education Committee (or as many as you can–every call helps) <a href="http://flsenate.gov/Committees/Show/ED/">here</a>.</p>
<p>We would especially urge you to contact <em>your</em> senator if he or she is on the list.</p>
<h2>
<u>What To Say</u>
</h2>
<p>When you call, say something like this in your own words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<em>I am calling to thank [President/Leader/Senator______] for putting SB 1726, the Parents’ Bill of Rights, on the Senate Education committee’s Week Six agenda. Parental rights are close to my heart, and I truly believe we need to protect our children by preserving parental rights in state law. The enduring American legal tradition that parents can best care for their children should be protected once and for all. Please support this measure in your committee and as it makes its way through the Senate.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you are a constituent, be sure to mention that when you introduce yourself, as well.</p>
<h2>
<u>Things to Remember</u>
</h2>
<p>Here are a few things to remember when calling the Senators’ offices:</p>
<ul>
<li>You will most likely not talk to the Senator.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>More often than not, you will speak to their legislative assistant or an intern, but they will convey your message to the Senator.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Always be polite and pleasant on the phone.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Often the person you will be talking to will not be the most agreeable. As the “first line of defense,” they take calls all day, many of which are not nearly as friendly as we strive to be. Give them a little grace; they will greatly appreciate it.</li>
<li>One of the easiest ways of sounding more pleasant on the phone is to smile as you talk. It comes through on the other end, and they will be able to “hear” you smile.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Don’t be stressed making calls.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Remember that you represent an amazing cause.</li>
<li>Also, remember that there are other people in your state calling these senators as well. You are not alone in the fight.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Please take a moment to contact them now. Thank you.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact Cory Gibbons at cory@parentalrights.org!</p>

<![CDATA[<p>The U.S. House Subcommittee on Civil Rights and Human Resources held a hearing on Tuesday, March 26, regarding efforts to reauthorize CAPTA—the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act.</p>
<p>While we were not able to get onto the witness list, our D.C. liaison Maggie McKneely was on hand for most of the hearing in person. I was able to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3NlPlh474k">watch the entirety</a> on the YouTube channel of the House Education and Work Force committee, of which this subcommittee is a part.</p>
<p>Perhaps more importantly, <strong>we were able to share our thoughts and concerns with members of the committee before the hearing even began.</strong>
</p>
<h2>CAPTA Change Is Coming</h2>
<p>First passed in 1974, CAPTA has since been reauthorized several times, always with amendments and changes to try to make the law more effective (with at best mixed results). With Democrats controlling the House and Republicans controlling the Senate, CAPTA is one of the few issues both parties favor working on this spring.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it seems everyone is aware that <strong>the current system is broken and must be fixed</strong>.</p>
<p>The hearing on Tuesday was the first opportunity to <strong>catch a glimpse of what changes lawmakers might be considering</strong> this time around. The signs were positive for at least some of the changes ParentalRights.org and our allies are working for.</p>
<p>For starters, the whole hearing was cordial. Anyone not “in the know” would have a hard time guessing which witnesses were enlisted by the Democrat majority and which was invited by the Republican minority. All four were largely in agreement on most of the issues addressed by CAPTA.</p>
<p>They were especially unified around the idea that <strong>prevention measures to keep families together are better than reactionary or punitive measures</strong> such as those employed by child welfare agencies under the current system. On this we agree.</p>
<p>More than one witness made the assertion that <strong>prevention involves educating and <em>supporting</em> parents</strong>, as opposed to looking for ways to “catch” them and take their children.</p>
<h2>Poverty Is Not Neglect</h2>
<p>And we found one exchange particularly encouraging.</p>
<p>Rep. Hayes (D-CT), who was a classroom teacher (and mandatory reporter) before her political career, expressed the need to know that when a report is called in, the actual underlying issues will be addressed. She wanted it clear for the record that abuse or neglect can happen anywhere, not just among poor minority families.</p>
<p>Dr. Yo Jackson of Penn State, one of the witnesses and a researcher by profession, gave a welcome response.<br>
“We are much better now, where we are in our science, at knowing what are the causal factors for child maltreatment,” she declared. Now that we have been tracking for a few decades, we have a lot more data. Families where abuse occurs have certain things in common, certain warning signs, like stress, lack of outside support, or conflict within the family. <strong>We are able to identify underlying issues, Jackson went on, and “<em>[p]overty is not one of them</em>” (Jackson’s emphasis).</strong>
</p>
<p>Obviously, such research can be taken too far. Over-zealous investigators may spot one or two “warning signs” and begin harassing innocent families without cause. Such “predictive analytics” are not an idea we would endorse.</p>
<p>On the other hand, testimony like Jackson’s bodes well for our “poverty is not neglect” language. <strong>Far too many families have been destroyed because parents lacked the resources to provide for their children</strong> at a level an investigator feels is necessary. Children are taken and placed in wealthier families, at a greater expense to the state than just helping the parents pay the rent for the month.</p>
<p>While we won’t know until a draft is available in a few weeks, we have cause to hope this “poverty is not neglect” provision will make it in.</p>
<h2>Having a Voice</h2>
<p>We have heard from members of the committee that the memo we have shared, alongside our allies in the United Family Advocates bipartisan coalition, has been <strong>instrumental in bringing at least some of our issues to the forefront</strong>. We won’t know to what degree until we see the CAPTA draft, but it is exciting to know we’re affecting the discussion in favor of parents and families.</p>
<p>Thank you for standing with us and for supporting our efforts with <a href="https://secure.parentalrights.org/np/clients/parentalrights/donation.jsp?campaign=5&amp;">your donations</a>. Because of you we are able to be on hand, not only to monitor and report, but to educate and influence committees just like this one.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Michael Ramey</p>
<p>P.S. — I am aware some of our readers will hold that CAPTA should be defunded altogether. Our best estimate of the political reality, however, is that CAPTA <em>will be reauthorized</em> in the coming months. Our best chance at protecting children, then, is to <strong>be sure the law is modified in a manner that helps, and does not harm, our families.</strong>

<![CDATA[<p>The newly formed <strong>House Subcommittee on Civil Rights and Human Services</strong> will meet on Tuesday, March 26, to discuss CAPTA reauthorization. CAPTA is the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, the vehicle by which the federal government grants money to states if they will follow <strong>federal guidelines regarding child welfare</strong> organizations.</p>
<h2>What’s the Rush?</h2>
<p>We were given very short notice of this hearing, but are working frantically with the bipartisan United Family Advocates coalition to secure an opportunity to provide written testimony on this vital issue. Our testimony would largely mirror our written CAPTA reauthorization statement, <a href="https://parentalrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/UFA-Letter-on-CAPTA-Reauthorization-2019-8.pdf">available online here</a>.</p>
<p>If we succeed in securing the opportunity, we will tell the committee that <strong>the law needs to be updated to respect and protect the rights of innocent families</strong>. We will urge them to end anonymous reporting, halt the confusion of poverty with neglect, and ensure due process for parents.</p>
<p>Because of the immediate nature of this opportunity—if the subcommittee will accept our testimony, we have to get it to them in a matter of hours—our regular weekly email has been put on hold for this week.</p>
<h2>Stay Tuned</h2>
<p>Stay tuned for further updates on this and other parental rights issues as both the Congress and state legislative sessions continue through this spring.</p>
<p>
<strong>Our ability to respond so quickly</strong> when opportunities like these arise is funded entirely by donors just like you. If you haven’t donated lately, please consider doing so <a href="https://secure.parentalrights.org/np/clients/parentalrights/donation.jsp?campaign=5&amp;">here</a>.</p>
<p>Thank you for standing with us in the fight to protect parental rights, and thank you for your support.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Michael Ramey<br>
Executive Director</p>

<em>Note: This week’s newsletter is an eye-witness report from Federal Relations Liaison Maggie McKneely. Here’s Maggie:</em>
</p>
<p>The well-publicized measles outbreaks In Washington, New York, and Texas have inflamed the debate over vaccines.</p>
<p>In recent months, we’ve seen a number of states <a href="../leg-update/">introduce legislation</a> that would either partially or entirely remove vaccine exemptions. California Congressman Adam Schiff introduced a <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-resolution/179/text">resolution</a> in the House of Representatives stating the importance of vaccines. And in the latest chapter, last week I attended the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee hearing on preventable disease outbreaks.</p>
<p>
<strong>Fortunately, there is still no proposed bill that would mandate vaccines from the federal level, but the pressure is climbing for lawmakers to act.</strong>
</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Our Position</h2>
<p>We at Parentalrights.org do not take a position on the medical efficacy or safety of vaccines. What we do believe is that <strong>medical decisions should be made by families – not politicians on Capitol Hill.</strong>
</p>
<p>There are few rights as fundamental as a parent’s right to direct the upbringing of their children. Whether that’s in regard to education or making informed medical decisions, when it comes to kids, parents know best – not the government.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Hearing</h2>
<p>The “fact-gathering session” titled “Vaccines Save Lives: What is Driving Preventable Disease Outbreaks?” was, as the name suggests, primarily a pro-vaccine hearing that focused on the effectiveness of certain vaccines. It featured five witnesses, four of whom were either licensed medical doctors or have decades of medical experience.</p>
<p>The fifth was Ethan Lindenberger, a high school student who has captured the attention of the media for getting vaccinated against his mother’s wishes. All five testified in favor of vaccines.</p>
<p>While no one suggested mandating vaccines from the federal level, the tone of the hearing was clear: <strong>the committee members and witnesses believe vaccines are an unequivocal societal good and anyone who disagrees poses a threat. </strong>
</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Opening Positions</h2>
<p>Sen. Alexander (R-TN), Chairman of the HELP committee, opened the hearing by saying that “we know that some Americans are hesitant about vaccines, so today I want to stress the importance of vaccines: not only has the Food and Drug Administration found them to be safe, but vaccines also save lives.”</p>
<p>Sen. Murray (D-WA), ranking member on the HELP committee, echoed Alexander’s statement. “These outbreaks are a clear sign we have to do more to address vaccine hesitancy and make sure parents have the facts they need to understand the science: vaccines are safe, effective, and life-saving.”</p>
<p>Much of the discussion between the committee members and witnesses focused on the benefits of vaccines and possible ways to increase vaccination rates, such as funding for vaccine education programs and solutions to make expensive vaccines more readily available. <strong>No one was seemingly interested in what may make some parents “vaccine hesitant,” just in how to make them less so. </strong>
</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Invalidating Parents</h2>
<p>The most alarming part of the hearing was the testimony and questioning of Lindenberger. Once he turned 18, he decided to get vaccinated, despite his mom being against vaccines. As a legal adult, it was fully within his right to make that decision. But the committee chose to elevate his testimony to the same level as the expertise of longtime-medical professionals, simply because his choice to go against his parents’ beliefs agreed with the committee’s agenda.</p>
<p>In so doing,<strong> the Committee communicated that parents’ opinions are only valid so long as they conform with the government’s.</strong>
</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">One Voice for Liberty</h2>
<p>The lone voice clearly in favor of liberty was Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), himself a licensed medical doctor . While he believes in the benefits of vaccines and has vaccinated all of his own children, he disagrees with the notion that it is up to the federal government to make that decision. He stated that “I believe that the benefits of vaccines greatly outweigh the risks, but <strong>I still do not favor giving up on liberty for a false sense of security</strong>” (emphasis added).</p>
<p>He pointed out that “this may be the only medical procedure in the modern world where informed consent is not required.”</p>
<p>Had the HELP committee been interested in a true fact-finding hearing, they could have listened to opposing opinions from individuals just as highly qualified as those present at the hearing.</p>
<p>For example, the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons recently <a href="https://aapsonline.org/measles-outbreak-and-federal-vaccine-mandates/">sent a letter</a> to the House Energy and Commerce Committee, stating their opposition to federally mandated vaccines. The letter suggested that “a public health threat is the rationale for the policy on mandatory vaccines. But how much of a threat is required to justify forcing people to accept government-imposed risks?”</p>
<p>Instead, the hearing was entirely one-sided.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Conclusion</h2>
<p>As Federal Relations Liaison, it is my job to keep an ear to the ground in the halls of Congress, and that includes what is said in a committee hearing related to parental rights.</p>
<p>In combating those we disagree with, it is crucial to have accurate information. <strong>The alarmist rumors that Congress is about to pass a vaccine mandate are overstated.</strong> As I mentioned, there is currently no bill in Congress that would mandate vaccines.</p>
<p>
<strong>But conversations are happening, and many are not favorable to parental rights.</strong> We are prepared to stand with you whenever the freedom to be a parent is threatened.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>
<a href="https://legislature.maine.gov/LawMakerWeb/summary.asp?ID=280071798" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LD 798</a>, <strong>a bill that threatens children and parental rights, is scheduled for a hearing next week.</strong> The measure comes before Maine’s Joint Standing Committee on Educational and Cultural Affairs on Wednesday, March 13, at 1:00 pm in Room 208 of the Cross Building in Augusta.</p>
<p>LD 798 would remove the right of parents to opt their child out of immunizations on the basis of a philosophical or religious belief exemption, <strong>dangerously shifting the power to make major medical decisions for a child from the parents to the state.</strong>
</p>
<p>In its 1979 <em>Parham v. J.R.</em> decision, the Supreme Court declared, “Simply because the decision of a parent…involves risks does not automatically transfer the power to make that decision from the parents to some agency or officer of the state.”</p>
<p>LD 798 in Maine would trample parental rights and turn that Court decision on its head.</p>
<p>While ParentalRights.org does not have a position on the safety or efficacy of vaccines, we are adamant in our support of the right of parents to make informed medical decisions for their children.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Action Items</h3>
<p>We and our allies at Homeschoolers of Maine (HOME) are encouraging concerned parents to <strong>show up on March 13 to attend the hearing.</strong> You will not be called on or have to testify, but your presence alone will demonstrate to lawmakers that parents are watching this vote closely.</p>
<p>Bear in mind if you are able to attend that many cannot due to work or other obligations, making it all the more important for you to be there. You can stand on behalf of those of us who cannot—and on behalf of the children this bill would affect.</p>
<p>If you are among those unable to attend, <strong>please take a moment to email the members of the committee and urge them to vote “No” on this bill.</strong> You can find their contact information at <a href="http://legislature.maine.gov/committee/#Committees/EDU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">legislature.maine.gov/committee/#Committees/EDU</a>.</p>
<p>
<strong>Vaccines themselves are a controversial issue, but the natural and inalienable right of parents to make decisions that children are not yet capable of making for themselves should not be.</strong>
</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to stand up for children and for parental rights.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Michael Ramey</p>
<p>Executive Director</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Our Resolutionary Campaign is in full force, currently pursuing passage of Parental Rights Amendment Resolutions in six states. In addition, more than a dozen battles are looming in other states, most over bills that would threaten everything from vaccine exemptions to the privacy of your own home.</p>
<p>There’s a lot to cover, so I’ll dive right in.</p>
<h3>
<strong>Parental Rights Amendment Resolutions</strong>
</h3>
<p>Resolutions calling on Congress to send the PRA to the States for ratification are on the table in six states, though only two have been introduced so far. In the lead is <a href="https://legiscan.com/OK/bill/SCR1/2019" target="_new">SCR 1</a> in <strong>Oklahoma</strong> which passed the state Senate on February 13. If the House adds its approval in the coming weeks, Oklahoma will be the seventh state to call on Congress to support the Amendment. (Six states passed resolutions in 2010-2013.)</p>
<p>
<a href="https://apps.legislature.ky.gov/record/19RS/SCR106.html" target="_new">SCR 106</a> in <strong>Kentucky</strong> was introduced by Sen. Steve West on February 14<sup>th</sup>. Because Kentucky has deadlines for bills but not for resolutions, the latter often sit until near the end of the session, so “no news” at this point is not necessarily bad news; we’ll have to be patient. Resolutions in Kentucky have been known to pass in as little as three days.</p>
<p>In three other states—<strong>Florida</strong>, <strong>Texas</strong>, and <strong>West Virginia</strong>—we have lead sponsors but have not yet seen the resolutions introduced. And an effort in <strong>South Carolina</strong> is under way, but we don’t have a sponsor there yet.</p>
<h3>
<strong>Parental Rights Statutes</strong>
</h3>
<p>The lead sponsor for our resolution in <strong>Florida</strong> is also looking to champion a bill that would preserve parental rights under Florida law. She plans to introduce both together once they are properly drafted and ready to go.</p>
<p>In <strong>Kentucky</strong>, the same Sen. West introduced <a href="https://apps.legislature.ky.gov/record/19RS/sb152.html#SCS1" target="_new">SB 152</a>, the Parents’ Bill of Rights, which passed the Senate Judiciary Committee last Thursday (Feb. 21). Some of the language is still being ironed out through anticipated floor amendments before the final Senate vote, after which the bill will move to the House. ParentalRights.org does not have volunteers “on the ground” in Frankfort, but we are actively working with key allies to promote this work.</p>
<h3>
<strong>Vaccine Exemptions</strong>
</h3>
<p>Vaccines are perhaps the most contentious aspect of the parental rights issue. We do not hold a position on the medical efficacy or safety of vaccines, but we are passionate about the liberty of parents to make informed medical decisions for their children.</p>
<p>The following states are currently considering legislation that would end vaccine exemptions or make them more challenging for philosophical or religious reasons:</p>
<p>
<strong>Minnesota</strong> <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bills/text.php?number=SF1520&amp;version=0&amp;session=ls91&amp;session_year=2019&amp;session_number=0&amp;format=pdf" target="_new">SF 1520</a> would remove all exemptions for “conscientiously held beliefs,” meaning religious or philosophical exemptions. (Photo above shows families at a rally in St. Paul on Feb. 25 to oppose SF 1520. Photo credit: Angie Gallagher.)</p>
<p>
<strong>Vermont</strong> <a href="https://legislature.vermont.gov/Documents/2020/Docs/BILLS/H-0238/H-0238%20As%20Introduced.pdf" target="_new">HB 238</a> would eliminate religious exemptions for all vaccines.</p>
<p>
<strong>New Jersey</strong> <a href="https://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2018/Bills/A4000/3818_I1.HTM" target="_new">SB 3818</a> would make it more difficult to claim a religious exemption for vaccines.</p>
<p>
<strong>Kentucky</strong> <a href="https://apps.legislature.ky.gov/record/19rs/sb133.html" target="_new">SB 133</a> would eliminate vaccine exemptions for college students. (This is outside our normal focus, but the intersect is those students who are still under the age of 18 and who, with their parents, oppose the vaccines.)</p>
<p>
<strong>Maine</strong> <a href="http://www.mainelegislature.org/legis/bills/display_ps.asp?ld=798&amp;PID=1456&amp;snum=129" target="_new">LD 798</a> would eliminate all philosophical or religious exemptions. Our allies at Homeschoolers of Maine (HOME) just alerted us that it is <strong>scheduled for committee on March 13 at 1:00 pm</strong> in Room 208 of the Cross Building in Augusta. (Be watching for further updates.)</p>
<p>
<strong>Nevada</strong> <a href="https://legiscan.com/NV/bill/AB123/2019" target="_new">AB123</a> would not eliminate philosophical or religious exemptions, but would require parents to file a letter of exemption every year instead of just once, which may create an additional inconvenience for parents who choose to exercise that right.</p>
<p>
<strong>Oregon</strong> <a href="https://olis.leg.state.or.us/liz/2019R1/Measures/Overview/HB3063" target="_new">HB 3063</a> would remove philosophical or religious exemptions to any vaccinations.</p>
<h3>
<strong>But Wait…</strong>
</h3>
<p>Although  <strong>Iowa’s</strong> <a href="https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation/BillBook?ga=88&amp;ba=HF206" target="_new">HF 206</a>, filed by Rep. Mascher, would eliminate religious exemptions, <a href="https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation/BillBook?ga=88&amp;ba=sf239" target="_new">SF 239</a>, filed by Sens. Guth and Zaun, would preserve these exemptions and allow for philosophical exemptions as well.</p>
<p>And <strong>Arizona</strong>’s legislature is considering <a href="https://legiscan.com/AZ/text/HB2470/id/1857420" target="_new">HB 2470</a>, <a href="https://legiscan.com/AZ/text/HB2471/2019" target="_new">HB 2471</a>, and <a href="https://legiscan.com/AZ/text/HB2472/2019" target="_new">HB 2472</a>, a series of bills by Rep. Nancy Barto that would strengthen the right of parents to make informed decisions for their children regarding vaccination and antibody titer testing (used to identify whether a child has antibodies for a particular disease). Two of these bills (HB 2471 and 2472) appear poised for a vote in the House soon.</p>
<h3>
<strong>Home Visitation Programs</strong>
</h3>
<p>Another troubling trend on the rise is home visitation programs around the country. Where these programs are voluntary, they do not threaten parental rights. In some states, though, the intention seems to be to put a government agent into the home of <em>every</em> newborn child, whether the parents want it or not. And these agents are, of course, mandatory reporters, which renders their visit a forensic search.</p>
<p>The home visitation bills we are watching, whether for voluntary or mandatory visits, include the following:</p>
<p>
<strong>Iowa </strong>
<a href="https://custom.statenet.com/public/resources.cgi?id=ID:bill:IA2019000S111&amp;ciq=ncsl&amp;client_md=6874d8058b541b9feeecc785a0347017&amp;mode=current_text" target="_new">SF 111</a> and <strong>New Hampshire</strong> <a href="https://custom.statenet.com/public/resources.cgi?id=ID:bill:NH2019000S274&amp;ciq=ncsl&amp;client_md=50e61eacf8cd271c0b94e5e93908b048&amp;mode=current_text" target="_new">SB 274</a> provide newborn home visitation for any child or family under Medicaid.</p>
<p>
<strong>Oregon</strong> <a href="https://custom.statenet.com/public/resources.cgi?id=ID:bill:OR2019000S526&amp;ciq=ncsl&amp;client_md=c062e5ef6e0940cf8e2827f0de8ce8db&amp;mode=current_text" target="_new">SB 526</a> calls on the Oregon Health Authority to study home visits and report to an interim health care committee of the Legislative Assembly later this year. Study bills are often precursors to actual changes in law, and Oregon Governor Brown already communicated in her budget proposal that she would like to make these visits “universal.”</p>
<p>
<strong>Washington</strong>’s “Welcome to Washington Baby Act,” <a href="https://custom.statenet.com/public/resources.cgi?id=ID:bill:WA2019000S5683&amp;ciq=ncsl&amp;client_md=8c1bda3566714e3980456f2a116559d7&amp;mode=current_text" target="_new">SB 5683</a>, would establish universal home visiting programs to link families of newborns to state services and resources. At present the measure is voluntary, but the trend especially in Washington and neighboring Oregon seems to be toward more and not less intrusion.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>In summary, there is a lot going on throughout the states that would affect your right to make the best decision for your child. As we watch these and other threatening or promising bills, we invite you to watch with us and alert us if you learn any of these are moving. We would also ask you to standby for alerts that might call on you to contact your lawmakers to support any good bill or oppose the bad.</p>
<p>Thank you for standing with us as we look to protect your children by empowering you, their parents, to make the vital decisions that will shape them for life!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Michael Ramey<br>
Executive Director</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Dear Champion of Parental Rights -</p>
<p>We can’t rest now.</p>
<p>
<strong>With the achievement of two major goals, this legislative session is off to a great start. But our work is only just beginning.</strong>
</p>
<p>The Resolutionary Campaign we revealed last August called for the Parental Rights Amendment (PRA) to be introduced early in this Congress, and we have hit that target. Rep. Jim Banks (R-IN) introduced the PRA on January 30, 2019 with the support of more than a dozen cosponsors. This is a huge step.</p>
<p>Our other goal was the introduction of PRA resolutions in as many states as possible, and that is happening, too, thanks to the tremendous work of some exciting new volunteers (and staff!).</p>
<p>In short, January brought tremendous victories.</p>
<p>As a result,<strong> we see amazing opportunities before us, made possible through careful planning, hard work, invested time, and the generosity of partners like you.</strong> Your continued support will help us keep this momentum.</p>
<p>And we’re going to need it.</p>
<p>On Capitol Hill, two distinct parties who cannot seem to work together tend to relegate our issue, our proposed Amendment, to one side or another—and, as a result, only that side will support it.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<strong>We know better. We know parental rights is neither a Democrat issue nor a Republican issue. Rather, it affects us all.</strong>
</p>
<p>From inner city minority single moms to rural homeschooler farming couples, and every demographic in between, parental rights are crucial to your everyday life.</p>
<p>Those broken by Child Protective Services (CPS), or raising a child with a disability or a chronic illness, or seeking alternative sources of education; those too poor to defend themselves in court, or working two or three jobs to make ends meet, or raising their child in a faith the local government seems unwilling to accept…. We know we are<em> all</em> in this together!</p>
<p>And the good news is America knows it, too.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://secure.parentalrights.org/np/viewDocument?orgId=parentalrights&amp;id=4028e4e55c813888015cfa25822f00ff" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Polling indicates</a> that <em>more than 90 percent of all</em> Americans, regardless of party affiliation, agree with the traditional position that, absent a showing of abuse or neglect, parents have the right to direct the upbringing, education, and care of their children.</p>
<p>For this reason, we are not a Democratic or Republican organization; this is not a Democrats- or Republicans-only cause.</p>
<p>Families <em>of every stripe</em> are best served when parents are protected from government intrusion and allowed to make the best decisions on behalf of their children!</p>
<p>The bottom line: Your children deserve to be cared for by you—the people who love them most.</p>
<p>We all understand that. It doesn’t matter where you live, how much you make, or who you voted for on Election Day.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<strong>No demographic matters as much as your children do.</strong>
</p>
<p>That’s why this Amendment is so important. It’s not just about protecting our rights, but protecting our families. It’s about protecting our children. Still, the fact that we are trying to pass an amendment to the U.S. Constitution means a simple majority vote in Congress is not enough. We need a two-thirds vote in the U.S. House and two-thirds in the Senate.</p>
<p>We will never reach those numbers with only one party’s support.</p>
<p>The bad news is that, unfortunately, experience shows that Congress lacks our understanding on this issue. They don’t see it as the full-spectrum, bipartisan issue we know it to be.</p>
<p>And that’s why these January victories—early Amendment introduction and the promotion of parental rights resolutions—are so important.</p>
<p>
<strong>First, resolutions demonstrate to a stubborn Congress that people in every political party support the Parental Rights Amendment.</strong>
</p>
<p>In 2011-2013, our early resolution efforts resulted in strong bipartisan support at the state level, including in Louisiana, where a split legislature voted overwhelmingly—in <em>both</em> houses—to call for the Parental Rights Amendment.</p>
<p>The resolutions we are promoting today can send this same message to Congress.</p>
<p>Second, getting the PRA introduced this early maximizes our time to gather additional cosponsors, push for committee hearings, and otherwise advance the Amendment on Capitol Hill.</p>
<p>Perhaps most significantly, this early start allows us to take advantage of an opportunity from this most recent Congressional election: several freshman lawmakers from the Democratic party have voting histories and constituencies back home that are favorable to parental rights.</p>
<p>
<strong>This means there’s a chance they will support our Amendment.</strong>
</p>
<p>One of these was the first Democrat to cosponsor a parental rights bill in his state legislature. Once he signed on, other Democrats followed, and the bill now enjoys the kind of widespread bipartisan support we need for the PRA.</p>
<p>That’s why it’s so important to secure the support of these freshman Democrats in Congress, as well. This new class offers a unique opportunity to finally build a bridge across the proverbial aisle.</p>
<p>We believe that, as in the case of that state bill, once one Democrat signs on, many will follow.</p>
<p>
<strong>Towards those ends, January has given us a terrific start in every respect, and we are thankful for what has been accomplished.</strong>
</p>
<p>The early introduction of the Amendment provides the bill number state resolutions needed in order to move forward.</p>
<p>It also gives us time to reach out to new members of Congress—including Democrats—and bring some of them on board in this term.</p>
<p>And the early introduction comes from a passionate champion of your rights, Congressman Jim Banks, who is actively pursuing support for our effort among his colleagues from either party.</p>
<p>
<strong>All the pieces are in place, and the doors lie open before us.</strong>
</p>
<p>But we still need your support to advance.</p>
<p>Would you take a moment to make your best gift of $25.00, $50.00, or even $100.00 today? With your support we can see victories upon victories in the days and weeks ahead.</p>
<p>Having seen so many resolutions introduced, we want to see as many of them as possible cross the finish line. Only then do they send the clear message to Congress that the states support your rights.</p>
<p>And every Democratic freshman in Congress offers a potential victory as well. For that matter, every new cosponsor, regardless of party, strengthens the chances of the Parental Rights Amendment in Congress.</p>
<p>
<strong>Your investment in this cause has fueled our Resolutionary Campaign through these crucial January accomplishments.</strong>
</p>
<p>Please double down on this winning strategy, and let’s push these victories all the way to Amendment adoption!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>James R. Mason, Esq.<br>
President</p>
<p>P.S. — January has been a month of significant victories, paving the way for a powerful legislative session both in Congress and the States. Your generous investment today will allow us to build on that foundation to protect our families—our children!—by preserving parental rights.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Dear Champion of Parental Rights,</p>
<p>This morning United Family Advocates, the bipartisan coalition with whom we are working on family law reforms, put our finishing touches on a letter to Congress outlining things we hope to add and to avoid in the upcoming re-authorization of the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA).</p>
<p>The 16-page document will be ready for public presentation in the next day or two, and when it is it will be posted on this page of our website. <a href="https://parentalrights.org/protect-children-families-and-the-constitution-in-capta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
<strong>
<span style="color: #993300;">PDF Here</span>
</strong>
</a>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<strong>Letter Highlights</strong>
</p>
<p>In the meantime, here are the highlights of the positions we have taken, joined by activists on both sides of the political aisle:</p>
<p>The current system takes too many children from innocent families. <strong>“[A] child abuse investigation is, itself, a trauma.”</strong>
</p>
<p>Foster care, though sometimes necessary, compounds the trauma.</p>
<p>CAPTA should be amended to expand protections for innocent families, including insuring fairer investigations, providing a notice of rights, and ceasing intervention against reasonably prudent parents. Further, services offered to help families in poverty or in other areas of need should be voluntary.</p>
<p>Of special importance,<strong> the standard for child removal must comport with the guarantee of Due Process provided in the U.S. Constitution.</strong>
</p>
<p>“Safety Plans” should be presented as voluntary unless they really are legally binding. The current practice of initiating such “agreements” under threat of taking children must be corrected.</p>
<p>Innocent parents should not be added to child abuse registries, and should be able to have their name expunged from such registries through appropriate appeal and a fair hearing.</p>
<p>Poverty should never be confused with neglect. <strong>Parents should not lose their children simply because they are poor.</strong>
</p>
<p>“Confidential” reporting should replace “anonymous” reporting, which will severely curb the abuse of child abuse hotlines. The hotline should not be a means for an embittered ex to accuse a fit parent of abuse when there is none. Requiring the caller to provide basic identifying information to the hotline (though still not to the accused) will go a long way to curing this problem.</p>
<p>We also rejected ideas of a national child abuse registry and of using predictive analytics to try to forecast who will be abusive or negligent, a system ripe for bias and abuse.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<strong>Broadly Diverse, But United</strong>
</p>
<p>The coalition includes such conservative organizations as the Texas Public Policy Institute alongside such liberal champions as Richard Wexler and NYU Law Professor Martin Guggenheim.</p>
<p>
<strong>Working together, we are able to find a welcoming audience in both the Democrat-led House and the Republican-led U.S. Senate, allowing us to make a difference in support of these family rights principles we all hold in common.</strong>
</p>
<p>In short, it is our hope this effort will effect real change for parents in child abuse investigation situations for years to come.</p>
<p>Thank you for standing with us as we stand with respected allies from across the spectrum to promote the protection of your family through your parental rights.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Michael</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Dear Champion of Parental Rights,</p>
<p>Rep. Jim Banks (IN-3) is introducing the Parental Rights Amendment in the U.S. House today, joined by fifteen cosponsors.</p>
<p>Maggie McKneely is ParentalRights.org’s federal relations liaison on Capitol Hill.</p>
<p>“Despite the negative, partisan atmosphere in DC right now,” Maggie reports, “the Parental Rights Amendment has garnered a lot of positive discussions. Our friends and supporters on Capitol Hill still consider the Parental Rights Amendment a priority and continue to champion it in the face of higher-profile issues.”</p>
<p>An early adjournment this week could easily have delayed introduction to Tuesday, but Rep. Banks recognized the need to send a message regarding the importance of this issue.</p>
<p>Through the work of Rep. Banks’ staff, Maggie’s contacts, and your many calls and emails to your congressmen’s offices, <strong>the Amendment has already garnered 15 cosponsors, including six who were not cosponsors of the prior Amendment effort from 2018.</strong>
</p>
<p>“We’ve been able to talk to the offices of freshman members and those who have never cosponsored and gotten people interested who haven’t been before,” Maggie tells me. “Parental rights is an issue all Americans can support, regardless of party, and many on the Hill recognize that.”</p>
<p>
<strong>Who’s on First?</strong>
</p>
<p>Fifteen members of Congress have signed on as “Original cosponsors,” meaning their names will already be on the PRA resolution when it is first introduced this afternoon.</p>
<p>Original cosponsors include: Rep. Alex Mooney (WV-2), Rep. Bill Posey (FL-8), Rep. Vicky Hartlzer (MO-4), Rep. Jeff Duncan (SC-3), Rep. Doug Lamborn (CO-5), Rep. Brian Babin (TX-36), Rep. Pete Olson (TX-22), Rep. Steve Watkins (KS-2), Rep. Debbie Lesko (AZ-8), Rep. Ron Wright (TX-6), Rep. Mark Meadows (NC-11), Rep. Ted Budd (NC-13), Rep. Doug LaMalfa (CA-1), Rep. Ted Yoho (FL-3), and Rep. Tim Walberg (MI-7).</p>
<p>
<strong>Take Action</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>If any of the above is your congressman,</strong> send them a short email thanking them for their support. <em>Don’t call their office</em>, as that ties up their time and resources. Our practice is to make phone calls (emails when necessary) to request or demand action, but to <strong>always send our thanks by email.</strong> Believe me: your congressman’s office will appreciate this!</p>
<p>If your congressional representative is not on the above list, it’s not too late to call them and ask them to sign on as a cosponsor. They won’t be “original cosponsors,” but they can still sign on to show support for parental rights.</p>
<p>You can find their contact information <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/map" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>When you call, <strong>tell them you are a constituent and that you are calling to encourage your representative to sign on with Rep. Jim Banks of Indiana as a cosponsor of the Parental Rights Amendment he is introducing this afternoon.</strong> (They can contact Tanner Spencer in Mr. Banks’ office.)</p>
<p>Your phone calls, coupled with Maggie’s visits and the tireless efforts of Rep. Banks and his staff, gained fifteen original cosponsors in only three weeks. Together we can gain even more support in the days ahead.</p>
<p>Rep. Banks’ strong leadership has put us in a great position for a strong showing in this new Congress.</p>
<p>Thank you for standing with us as we prepare for exciting days of Amendment progress ahead!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Michael T. Ramey<br>
Executive Director</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Dear Champion of Parental Rights,</p>
<p>Are the headlines true? Are universal mandatory home visits coming to Oregon in the near future?</p>
<p>At first read, it appears Oregon Governor Kate Brown’s latest <a href="https://www.oregon.gov/DHS/ABOUTDHS/LegislativeInformation/Gov.%20Brown%2019-21%20Budget.pdf">budget proposal</a> would introduce over the next six years <strong>a program of mandatory in-home visits for every family</strong> with a newborn child. Not just adoptive homes, or foster homes, or homes under investigation. Every home.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<strong>Every New Parent</strong>
</p>
<p>“This isn’t something for people in trouble. This is stuff all kids need. Stuff my kids needed,” says Patrick Allen, director of the Oregon Health Authority, <a href="http://cni.pmgnews.com/bvt/15-news/416006-317486-sherwood-resident-at-center-of-health-care-battles">in an interview</a> with the Beaverton (Oregon) Valley Times published January 3.</p>
<p>Should the plan be adopted—and should it be universally mandatory—it would call for every new parent in the state to “receive a series of two or three visits by someone like a nurse or other health care practitioner,” according to the Times article.</p>
<p>Some 40,000 babies are born in Oregon annually, though certainly not all of these are to new (or “first-time”) parents.</p>
<p>
<strong>The big question, though, is whether the visits would be mandatory. </strong>Providing universal home visits for <em>all who want them</em> is a far cry from requiring universal home visits of <em>every family</em> celebrating the birth of their firstborn.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<strong>Cause for Confusion</strong>
</p>
<p>The confusion seems to arise from page 42 of the budget proposal, which states that the budget includes funds for “universal home visiting.” The idea is expanded on pages 56-57:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“<strong>Universal Home Visiting</strong> — Home visiting programs are a proven way of creating a safe and healthy environment for children by supporting parents and families with information and services that provide the foundation for a lifetime of physical and mental well-being. The Governor’s Budget recognizes this through an $8.7 million investment for a Universal Home Visiting program to complement existing home visiting services by helping families enter into their community system of care.”</p>
<p>So, does “universal” mean “universally available?” Or does it mean “for every family without exception?” The latter is the literal meaning of the word, and thus the cause for much alarm. But is that as the governor’s office intends?</p>
<p>Ultimately, we do not know.</p>
<p>The Budget on pages 20-21 expresses support for “the Early Learning Council and the Early Learning System Director” whose responsibilities include “preschool, childcare licensing and regulation, and<em> voluntary</em> home visiting” (emphasis added), which could be a good sign. But uncertainty remains.</p>
<p>The Oregon Senate has recently taken up SB 526 requiring “The Oregon Health Authority [to] study home visiting by licensed health care providers in the state [and] submit findings and recommendations for legislation to an interim committee of the Legislative Assembly” by the end of the calendar year.”</p>
<p>This is no doubt connected to the governor’s budget, but this too does nothing to reveal the extent to which “universal” home visits are intended to be universal.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<strong>Bad Policy</strong>
</p>
<p>The Parental Rights Foundation has found mandatory home visits of innocent families to be simply bad policy. In addition to raising Fourth Amendment and parental rights issues, they do nothing good for families. Any benefits that voluntary visits may offer are easily offset in mandatory visits by the trauma a child experiences in finding at too early an age that their parents aren’t capable of protecting them from intrusion at all.</p>
<p>Studies have shown that children develop their sense of trust in part from the impression they hold in their formative years that their parents are, as one mom put it to us, “Superman or Superwoman,” able to defend their child from anything bigger than the little one can handle. Children robbed of this sense of safety (delusional though it may be) are also robbed of their ability to form trust bonds and lasting relationships for years, if not for a lifetime.</p>
<p>And make no mistake: <strong>home visits, even by licensed medical personnel, would constitute a violation of family privacy if the visit is unwanted.</strong> Licensed medical practitioners are by law mandatory reporters; once they are inside your home they are a <em>de facto</em> investigative agent of the State. That may create an adversarial medical relationship and introduce a level of stress unhealthy for any family.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this whole matter hinges on Oregon’s definition of “universal.” Truly universal home visits, including to families who do not want them, are bad policy and will reap serious negative consequences for children. But making sure the service is available to any who want it—and only those who want it—poses no direct threat to our parental rights.</p>
<p>Until Governor Brown’s intentions are clear, we will monitor her proposal with great interest.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Michael T. Ramey<br>
Executive Director</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Dear Champion of Parental Rights,</p>
<p>State legislatures all over the country reconvened this week (or last), and in some of them the issue of<span style="color: #ff9900;">
<strong> parental rights is, if not front and center, at least high on the agenda.</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>Sadly, in recent years many states have taken up bills that would further erode parental rights, such as California’s law to force a one-size-fits-all vaccination schedule on every child. Fortunately, while these bills have been introduced all over the country, they have been defeated far more often than not so far. But be warned: their advocates will not give up easily.</p>
<p>On the other hand, some states are about to introduce bills that defend parental rights. Utah’s new parenting law from 2018 covers a laundry list of fixes, from “free-range parenting” to clear language providing that family poverty does not constitute child neglect.</p>
<p>This year we are adding to the mix not only additional statutes, but state resolutions calling for Congress to adopt the Parental Rights Amendment.<strong> These resolutions are not legally binding, but add urgency and legitimacy for a U.S. senator or representative to cosponsor or vote in favor of that measure.</strong>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<span style="color: #ff9900;">
<strong>A Solid Start</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>It is very early in the state legislative season, so we don’t have actual introductions or bill numbers yet. But <a href="https://parentalrights.org/">ParentalRights.org</a> volunteers are already active all over the country to bring those victories about, and they are reporting real progress.</p>
<p>Our leader in <strong>Pennsylvania</strong> has talked with multiple potential sponsors and narrowed the field to two particularly interested (and effective) lawmakers. Meanwhile, sponsors in other states assure us that a statute or resolution introduction is imminent—including measures in <strong>Nebraska, Texas, Florida, and Indiana.</strong>
</p>
<p>Of these, Indiana is especially exciting because we did not have any grassroots presence there six months ago. Now our small but passionate team has come together to bring a resolution nearly to the point of introduction. <strong>That is a major step!</strong>
</p>
<p>But the other efforts are just as encouraging. In fact, as I write this I just got off the phone with a possible lead sponsor for Florida, who expressed her passion to protect families not just on paper, but with a bill that will “have some teeth.”</p>
<p>(While I’m keeping sponsor names “close to the vest” at this writing, we will provide those details publicly as bills and resolutions are introduced over the next couple of weeks.)</p>
<p>I’ve also heard from allied and like-minded organizations in other states who will be introducing parent-friendly, family-protecting bills in their legislatures in the days ahead—bills we will not shepherd ourselves, but which will support your rights. We will work with these organizations to secure victories for their bills, as well.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<span style="color: #ff9900;">
<strong>Exciting News Yet To Come</strong>
</span>

<![CDATA[<p>Dear Champion of Parental Rights,</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>It’s time!</strong>
</span> Today is the day to call Congress in preparation for the introduction of the Parental Rights Amendment (PRA) in the U.S. House.</p>
<p>Last month we met with Rep. Jim Banks (R-IN), and he agreed wholeheartedly to become the lead sponsor of the Parental Rights Amendment in this new session of Congress.</p>
<p>The new Congress convened on Thursday, January 3, and Rep. Banks is ready to hit the ground running. He is already enlisting original cosponsors so he can introduce the PRA later this month with a strong showing of support. <span style="color: #cc7700;">He’s waiting a couple of weeks before introduction to give <strong>
<em>your</em>
</strong> congressman the opportunity to join him.</span>
</p>
<p>But we need <em>
<strong>you</strong>
</em> to let your congressman know that!</p>
<p>Right now we need you to <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>call your representative and invite them to sign on</strong>
</span> with Rep. Banks as an original cosponsor of the Parental Rights Amendment in the House.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<strong>Here’s all you need to do:</strong>
</p>
<p>1. Find your congressman’s contact information <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/map" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here.</a>
</p>
<p>2. Call their office and tell them the following, in your own words:</p>
<p>“I am a constituent and I’m calling to ask my congressman to support my family by protecting our parental rights. Right now Rep. Banks of Indiana is gathering initial cosponsors on a proposed Parental Rights Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. I would encourage my representative to become one of those initial cosponsors. You can sign up by contacting Tanner Spencer in Mr. Banks’ office.”</p>
<p>If they ask for a bill number (which many will do out of habit), gently remind them we’re looking for original cosponsors, so there isn’t a bill number yet.</p>
<p>3. Spread the word to your family and friends and urge them to reach out to their congressmen, too!</p>
<p>For many of you, your congressman has sponsored the PRA in the past. <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>Call and urge them to do so again;</strong>
</span> they will be grateful to you for telling them who to contact to make that happen. (Again, that’s Tanner Spencer in Rep. Banks’ office.)</p>
<p>For others, your congressman has never been part of the PRA effort. But this new Congress gives them the perfect opportunity to start fresh in showing their commitment to you and your family’s rights.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>So please take a moment to call.</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>Together we can launch the Parental Rights Amendment early in this Congress with a strong showing of bipartisan support. So let’s get on the phone and make it happen!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Michael T. Ramey<br>
Executive Director</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Dear Champion of Parental Rights,</p>
<p>Thanks to you, we are doing something very few non-profits have accomplished in all of history: <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>we are <em>changing the culture</em> for families in America.</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>When a child services investigator knocked on my door on April Fool’s Day 2003, it was no joke. We had no idea who “called us in,” or what their concerns were supposed to be. But we knew one thing for sure. <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>Fifteen years ago, if CPS was investigating your family, you didn’t tell a soul.</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>After all, if you’re under a child welfare investigation, something must be going on, right?</p>
<p>That was the assumption fifteen years ago. It was the assumption ten years ago when I started with ParentalRights.org.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>But today, more and more families know the truth.</strong> </span>Thanks to the work of the Parental Rights Foundation and ParentalRights.org, the facts are getting out.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style="color: #1c8296;">
<strong>Today we know nearly 40% of all American children</strong> </span>will be involved in a child welfare investigation before they reach the age of 18.¹ We know more than 400,000 children will spend time in foster care this year.²</li>
<li>
<span style="color: #1c8296;">
<strong>We know more than 2,100 children are removed</strong>
</span> from their homes every three days in this country—removed by government agents due to accusations of abuse or neglect.³</li>
<li>
<span style="color: #1c8296;">
<strong>We know that in many states, minority children</strong>
</span>—sometimes African-American, sometimes Native American, sometimes Hispanic—are removed from their homes at double or even triple the rate of white children, a phenomenon likely due in part to nothing more than “good old-fashioned” bias.⁴</li>
<li>
<span style="color: #1c8296;">
<strong>We know that 83% of child welfare cases</strong>
</span> will ultimately be closed as unfounded or unsubstantiated, that 5 of every 6 children will have suffered the intrusion for no reason. And we know that 100% of them will be traumatized by the experience.⁵</li>
<li>
<span style="color: #1c8296;">
<strong>We know, conversely, that only 17% of child welfare investigations</strong>
</span> uncover evidence of abuse or neglect. And we know that number drops to only 4% when we look only at those investigations that spring from anonymous reports.⁶</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks to the work of ParentalRights.org and other non-profit organizations and coalitions that have arisen in our wake, Americans are waking up to the true nature of this epidemic. Families are being destroyed, not by abuse, but by the system we have put in place to protect the children from abuse.</p>
<p>Our families are being torn apart for want of good laws that protect the right of innocent families to live in peace, free of government intrusion.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>With this knowledge, we are changing the culture.</strong> </span>And it’s a good thing we are. Because every day more families are torn apart, and they need protecting.</p>
<p>Because nothing short of a cultural shift will enable us to pass the Parental Rights Amendment, the ultimate defense to protect families from this government invasion.</p>
<p>Until we succeed, the threats still remain.</p>
<h2>The Threats Still Abound, but Americans Are Taking a Visible Stand</h2>
<p>
<a name="threats">
</a>
<br>
There are still “experts” like Professor James Dwyer who teach that parental rights are conferred by the government at the birth of a child. And what the government gives, the government can withhold or take away, not because you’re guilty of abuse or neglect, but simply because the government believes it can do better by that child.</p>
<p>There are still doctors like those at Boston Children’s Hospital who took Justina Pelletier from her family a few years ago simply because they disagreed with her medical diagnosis. They imprisoned her in the hospital’s psych ward and withheld the medical treatment she needed, all backed by the authority of Massachusetts’ Department of Children and Families.</p>
<p>Sadly, such cases seem to be on the increase.</p>
<p>It shouldn’t be surprising, I guess. Often when the truth starts to come out, those who oppose it will double down. But I am hopeful that’s not going to fly in America.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>In other nations, threats to parental rights have been obvious:</strong>
</span>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style="color: #1c8296;">
<strong>We watched in horror as this year in Britain little Alfie Evans</strong>
</span> followed the same path as Charlie Gard the year before. Struck with a rare and unknown illness, Alfie was held in a London hospital that ultimately decided to end his care. Like Charlie, his parents were cut out of the decision. Offers to take up his care came from other hospitals—even other nations—but all went unheeded. The public raised tremendous funds and raised their voices, but the outcry was ignored. The British courts backed the hospital instead of recognizing the parents’ right to save their child. Just like Charlie Gard, Alfie Evans was laid to rest, a victim of the State’s power over his parents.</li>
<li>
<span style="color: #1c8296;">
<strong>In Norway, Amy Jakobsen lost her rights to her son, Tyler,</strong> </span>five years after the Barnevernet took him from her custody because she dared to breastfeed him at 19 months. He was healthy, and Amy was monitoring his weight closely to make sure he stayed that way. But the government seized him anyway, and even changed his name multiple times to keep his parents from finding him.</li>
<li>
<span style="color: #1c8296;">
<strong>And in Canada, Toronto’s SickKids hospital unveiled a policy to allow terminally-ill teenagers to opt for euthanasia, or “assisted suicide,” <em>without a parent’s consent.</em>
</strong> </span>This policy ignores the vital role of parents not only as a safeguard to help their adolescent child make the best decisions, but also as a safeguard against any dishonesty on the part of the hospital. Under this policy, what is to keep a hospital from ending a child’s life at the doctor’s convenience, then telling the family it was the child’s decision? There are reasons children have parents to protect their interests.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>Sadly, threats to the parent-child relationship continue in America as well.</strong> </span>Doctors and hospitals have taken so many children from innocent parents that the practice has given rise to a new term in our vocabulary: medical kidnapping. And a counter-scientific belief in the now debunked “Shaken Baby Syndrome” has birthed an entire new field of “child abuse pediatricians,” whose entire purpose seems to be diagnosing a guilty verdict.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>But, thanks to you, the culture is shifting. Though threats still abound, Americans are starting to take a visible stand.</strong>
</span>
</p>
<ul>
<li>This last year when 16-year-old Alyssa was medically kidnapped by the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, her parents did a little digging and discovered this kind of thing happens all the time. They learned they were not alone. But they also learned the deck was stacked against them. <span style="color: #1c8296;">
<strong>So they sprang into action, rescuing Alyssa from her prison</strong>
</span> before the nurses could realize what was happening.Of course, the hospital called in law enforcement. But the police were a little skeptical, and Alyssa’s father had a plan.First, he drove out of Minnesota to neighboring South Dakota. Once there, he took Alyssa to another well-respected hospital, where they got a second opinion: his daughter did not need the care the Mayo Clinic was forcing on her.Armed with this new diagnosis, the Minnesota police, who seemed less than enthusiastic about persecuting the family in the first place, were quick to stand down.</li>
<li>Also in Minnesota this year, a class-action lawsuit was filed against the state’s child welfare division because of the vast number of innocent families harmed by state intrusion. Despite the agency’s best efforts to get the case dismissed, it went to trial in a federal court in October. It is too early yet to know the outcome, but<span style="color: #1c8296;">
<span style="color: #1c8296;">
<strong> the fact that the court is hearing it at all shows a change from just a few years ago.</strong>
</span>
</span>
</li>
<li>
<span style="color: #1c8296;">
<strong>Another refreshing change just came in Texas,</strong> </span>where a Houston judge in November ordered CPS to pay $127,000 in damages to a family for illegally removing children from their parents’ custody without legal cause. What’s more, the court issued a “do not contact” order prohibiting the agency from bothering the family again.</li>
<li>And in Indiana, mother Stefanie Thomas, whose rights were terminated in a July hearing so secret even Stefanie didn’t know about it, <span style="color: #1c8296;">
<strong>got those rights reinstated.</strong> </span>When she got a lawyer and attempted to take CPS to court for their failure to grant her due process, the agency back-pedaled, conceded her point, and returned her child, rather than face the very real possibility that a judge would rule against them.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>Glimmers of hope. That’s what these cases represent.</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>They are not yet a new normal in America, as much as I’d like to report otherwise.</p>
<p>But these cases do offer hope. They are clear signs that the culture is changing.</p>
<p>Fifteen years ago, my wife and I suffered in silence and shame, knowing no one would believe we were good parents if they learned we were “under investigation.” (We were eventually exonerated, our case closed. But the case remained open for an agonizing ten months, eight months longer than Virginia law allows.)</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>Today, parents are filing lawsuits, rescuing daughters out of hospital prisons, and even talking to the press in an effort to push back.</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>Because they know the truth. They don’t have to feel guilty, and they know they’re not alone.</p>
<p>You have been a crucial part of changing that landscape.</p>
<p>When I started with ParentalRights.org ten years ago, no one we talked to understood what “parental rights” were or why anyone would need to fight for them. But now, people know what our name is about. They have seen their own rights limited or taken away. They have seen a neighbor’s family destroyed by a gratuitous invasion.</p>
<p>They understand that parental rights aren’t rights <em>over</em> children, but rights for children against the government. They understand it’s about protecting <em>the child’s right</em> to be represented and protected by loving parents, not impersonal bureaucrats.</p>
<p>And they understand these things because of the faithful work we have been doing for more than a decade.</p>
<p>It has been a slow climb.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style="color: #1c8296;">
<strong>We have lobbied Congress,</strong>
</span> especially to pass the Parental Rights Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.</li>
<li>
<span style="color: #1c8296;">
<strong>We have urged changes to the Adoption and Safe Families Act (ASFA)</strong> </span>and the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA), two federal laws that pay states to take children unnecessarily and return them only at a snail’s pace. We have lobbied (and continue to lobby) for doing away with “anonymous reporting” (remember, only 4% of such calls have any merit anyway!) and replacing it with “confidential reporting,” where at least law enforcement knows who called.</li>
<li>
<span style="color: #1c8296;">
<strong>We have lobbied states across the country</strong>
</span> to change their laws for the good of families, and a dozen states have done so. Utah’s brand-new law, which makes clear not only that parents can choose to give their children a reasonable measure of freedom as they mature, but also that poverty does not constitute neglect, sets an example for many other states to follow.</li>
<li>
<span style="color: #1c8296;">
<strong>And just last month, for the first time in our history, we lobbied a sitting President</strong>
</span> when we urged President Trump’s Administration to act on behalf of Amy and Tyler Jakobsen in Norway.</li>
<li>
<span style="color: #1c8296;">
<strong>We have been instrumental in connecting volunteers and organizations,</strong>
</span> and in making people aware of legal resources to defend their families. We have seen countless other organizations form to defend parents as well, their own successes fueled by our research and lobbying efforts.</li>
<li>
<span style="color: #1c8296;">
<strong>And we have educated everyone who will listen</strong>
</span> on the plight of parental rights. We’ve talked with distraught parents on the streets of Detroit, and with members of Congress in the halls of the Capitol.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>Thanks to you, we have opened a lot of eyes.</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>And the more eyes we open, the more parents stand up for themselves.</p>
<p>The more eyes we open, the more lawmakers understand the seriousness of the situation. No one wants an Alfie Evans or Charlie Gard situation here in America (except perhaps Professor Dwyer).</p>
<p>The more eyes we open, the louder the outcry grows for the Parental Rights Amendment.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>But we can’t do any of this important work without your continued, vital support.</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>In 2019, we will</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style="color: #1c8296;">
<strong>be pushing for resolutions in as many states as possible,</strong>
</span> resolutions that call on Congress to pass the Parental Rights Amendment.</li>
<li>
<span style="color: #1c8296;">
<strong>continue lobbying</strong>
</span>, as part of a bipartisan coalition (which means we’ll have a friendly audience in both the Democratic House and the Republican Senate), to fix the problems in ASFA and CAPTA that have resulted in so many traumatized homes.</li>
<li>
<span style="color: #1c8296;">
<strong>develop model language,</strong>
</span> based on Utah’s new statute, to encourage every state to decriminalize good parenting and draw a clear line between poverty and neglect.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>We will do all these things because <em>they must be done</em> if the culture is to continue to change in our families’ favor.</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>But we can only do these things <a href="https://secure.parentalrights.org/np/clients/parentalrights/donation.jsp?campaign=5&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">with your generous support.</span>
</a>
</p>
<p>That’s why today, as we wind down 2018, I am urging you to give your best donation to support this vital cause into the next calendar year.</p>
<p>
<a class="link-button" href="https://secure.parentalrights.org/np/clients/parentalrights/donation.jsp?campaign=5&amp;">Donate Now</a>
</p>
<p>Together, we can see states urging Congress to pass the Parental Rights Amendment. We can change the law to protect a child’s right to walk to school with her parent’s permission, or to play “unattended” in his own back yard.</p>
<p>With your help, we can continue to inform and inspire “investigated” parents to stand up for their rights—and their child’s rights—to get the justice they deserve.</p>
<p>And as the victories stack up, <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>so do our chances to protect these rights permanently in the U.S. Constitution.</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>Some of the victories listed in this email were our direct doing; many were not. But we are proud to play a <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>vital educational and networking role</strong> </span>that makes more and more victories like these possible.</p>
<p>With your <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
<a href="https://secure.parentalrights.org/np/clients/parentalrights/donation.jsp?campaign=5&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ongoing financial support</a>
</span>, we will faithfully continue to play that role in the coming year, and I believe we will see some of the greatest victories ever for innocent families nationwide.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and for your generous loyalty to this vital effort.</p>
<p>
<a class="link-button" href="https://secure.parentalrights.org/np/clients/parentalrights/donation.jsp?campaign=5&amp;">Donate Now</a>
</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Michael T. Ramey<br>
Executive Director</p>
<p>P.S. — Real threats remain as enemies of parental rights double down on their heavy-handed, pro-intrusion policies. <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>But every family who pushes back creates a chance for victory, and every victory moves us closer to the goal</strong> </span>of preserving our families’ rights permanently. We are seeing the culture change. <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>We are <em>fueling</em> the culture change.</strong>
</span> And with your help, we can continue the work in 2019 and beyond. Thank you for standing with us through your <a href="https://secure.parentalrights.org/np/clients/parentalrights/donation.jsp?campaign=5&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">generous donation</span>

<![CDATA[<p>What do</p>
<ul>
<li>a California school of social work,</li>
<li>a vaccine apologist, and</li>
<li>the government</li>
</ul>
<p>have in common?</p>
<p>No, it’s not just that they’re the traditional enemies of parental rights. Rather, in the last two months <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>ParentalRights.org has been invited into conversation with all of them!</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>As a nation we see too many children suffer unnecessary removal from loving parents in perfectly good homes. Too many families live in fear rather than freedom.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>It is high time we had some serious conversations as to what we’re going to do about it.</strong> </span>Fortunately, we are not the only people who think so.</p>
<h2>Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe</h2>
<p>Last month I received a call from the <a href="https://www.csce.gov/about-commission-security-and-cooperation-europe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe</span>
</a>, or the “U.S. Helsinki Commission.” (From their website, the Commission “monitor[s] compliance with the Helsinki Accords and advance[s] comprehensive security through promotion of human rights, democracy, and economic, environmental, and military cooperation in the 57-nation OSCE region.”)</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>The Commission planned to address parental rights and family integrity at an upcoming briefing, and they called us to learn our concerns.</strong> </span>What is the pulse of family rights not just in Europe, where Norway’s Barnavernet is taking children away without cause, or where Germany and the Scandinavian countries prohibit home schooling, but here in the States, as well?</p>
<p>We talked about the 83% of child welfare investigations that are ultimately unfounded or unsubstantiated. We talked about how easily children are “medically kidnapped” if parents disagree with their health care provider, and about the lack of due process in “Shaken Baby Syndrome” cases, where a child abuse “expert” proclaims guilt or innocence.</p>
<h2>Social Work Professor</h2>
<p>Then last week I spoke with a social work professor from one of California’s state universities. She is <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>putting together a program to provide her social work students with the parents’ perspective</strong>
</span> so that when they become professional investigators, they will be better prepared to respect parents and serve the needs of the families, instead of just taking children. As she put it, she wants to “re-professionalize child welfare,” to “stop repeating the same mistakes that have led to so much friction” between the system and the families in it.</p>
<h2>Pharmaceutical Manufactures</h2>
<p>Lastly, at a recent D.C. conference I had a wonderful conversation with a former pharmaceutical marketer. Now with a large biotechnology trade association, she represents many of the companies who manufacture the vaccines our lawmakers are mandating without exemption today. Yet <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>she and I were able to have a warm and constructive conversation about the concerns of parents</strong> </span>and the non-transferable responsibility we have to make the best medical decisions for our individual children.</p>
<p>We talked about the road blocks to conversation when it comes to vaccines. We share a concern that parents in some locations are denied quality health care simply because they oppose vaccinating their child or choose not to vaccinate on the doctor’s schedule.</p>
<p>Mostly, we talked about the need to have the conversation. We talked about the need to protect our common interests in health, for instance, without demanding that families give up their rights to privacy and self-determination.</p>
<h2>We’re Having the Conversations Because of You!</h2>
<p>To be fair, these relationships are all in their infancy. I have no stunning conclusions to share, no amazing breakthroughs to pass along. But these are very much the kind of conversations we want to be a part of!</p>
<p>As I write, I’ve just completed a special year-end message asserting that we are changing the culture for the better. These conversations were too new to make it into that letter, but they perfectly exemplify its point.</p>
<p>Through perseverance and your faithfulness, <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>we have caught the attention of organizations with influence</strong>
</span> to change the way parents are viewed in some crucial situations. They in turn have reached out to hear what we have to say about your children, your families, and your rights.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>What an amazing privilege to come to the table with the traditional enemies of parental rights</strong>
</span>—the government, the vaccine industry, and a school of social work! What a powerful opportunity to speak into the issues on your behalf!</p>
<p>We would not have been invited apart from your <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
<a href="https://secure.parentalrights.org/np/clients/parentalrights/donation.jsp?campaign=5&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">faithful support</a> </span>through the years. So thank you for standing with us.</p>
<p>I can’t wait to see what fruit will follow in 2019!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Thanks to you, we once again exceeded our goal for #GivingTuesday, and I don’t mean by a little.</p>
<p>All told, <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>this Giving Tuesday raised $30,733.50,</strong>
</span>including $2,140.00 to our educational arm, the Parental Rights Foundation.</p>
<p>
<em>(Gifts to the Foundation can only be used for education regarding parental rights and policy, while the remaining gifts to ParentalRights.org can also be used to directly fuel our lobbying and law-changing efforts in the states.)</em>
</p>
<p>Our goal for one-day giving was $20,000: $10,000 in matching grants secured in advance, and $10,000 from all of you.</p>
<p>Instead, you nearly reached the $20,000 by yourselves, raising more than $18,500 even without the matching grants!</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>I am overwhelmed with your out-pouring of generosity to empower parents to protect their children.</strong>
</span>We will take seriously our obligation to make the best use of your gifts to continue to change the legal landscape for families throughout the country.</p>

<strong>Clarification:</strong> The last $2,000 grant earns money for <a href="https://parentalrightsfoundation.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Parental Rights Foundation</a>, which means the money will go to education, not lobbying. However, we can earn that grant through your donation to either <a href="https://secure.parentalrights.org/np/clients/parentalrights/donation.jsp?campaign=51">ParentalRights.org</a> (which we can use to lobby) or the <a href="https://parentalrightsfoundation.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Foundation</a>.</em>
</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #1c8296;">
<strong>Every three days, roughly 2,000 children are taken</strong>
</span> from their homes over allegations of abuse or neglect. Statistically, nearly 1,700 of those are taken unnecessarily. <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>So we went on the road today to help put a stop to it.</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>As I write it’s 3:50 pm on the East coast, and our #GTRoadTrip is well underway. Maggie and Shellby are at this moment making their way from Harrisburg, PA back to our Virginia office for the final stop on their state capitals tour.</p>
<p>Our #GivingTuesday campaign is well underway, too. <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>So far we have raised $7,880, plus the same amount in matching funds, bringing us to 79% of our $20,000 one-day goal.</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>If you’ve already given today, we want to thank you so much for your generous support!</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #1c8296;">
<strong>But we’re not finished yet.</strong> </span>In fact, we received a last-minute matching grant of $2,000 more, meaning <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>every dollar will be matched not up to $20,000, but up to $24,000.</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>Please, if you haven’t given yet (or even if you have but can afford to give a little more), don’t let us leave those grants on the table!</p>

<span style="color: #1c8296;">
<strong>Every three days: We’ve mentioned it several times in the last six months.</strong> </span>Like you, we understand that there is no greater protection for children in America than their parents—and the best way to protect that relationship from unwarranted intrusion is through the Parental Rights Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which our state resolutions will help bring about.</p>
<p>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">

<strong>So take a moment to protect the children through your gift to ParentalRights.org.</strong>

<span style="color: #178296;">
<strong>Will you “remember the Children” by <a style="color: #178296;" href="https://secure.parentalrights.org/np/clients/parentalrights/donation.jsp?campaign=51" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-link-type="web" data-segment-action="add" data-segment-id="ac7b6ce0-a4a1-11e8-b45d-d4ae5292c2ac">
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">helping us reach our 1-day donation goal of $20,000</span>
</a>
</strong>
</span> to fuel state resolutions that promote the Parental Rights Amendment to the U.S. Constitution?</p>
<p>You recognize, as we do, that the very best way to protect children is by preserving their right to be raised by the parents who love them. Every day, more than 700 children are removed from their homes, in many instances just because someone else thinks they know better.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>Today is the day to remember these children and raise both awareness and support for parental rights!</strong>
</span>
</p>
<h2>Here’s What We’re Asking You to Do.</h2>
<p>
<span style="color: #178296;">
<strong>1. Give whatever you can.</strong> </span>We have been blessed with donors offering matching grants totaling $10,000. That means for every dollar you give, ParentalRights.org will receive $2—all the way up to our $20,000 goal!</p>
<p>
<a class="link-button" href="https://secure.parentalrights.org/np/clients/parentalrights/donation.jsp?campaign=51">Donate Now.</a>
</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #178296;">
<strong>2. Post a “family heart selfie”</strong>
</span>— Post a selfie of yourself with your family (a drawing or picture works!) with a heart on social media. Caption the photo with a note that tells your friends that you supported ParentalRights.org this #GivingTuesday.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://parentalrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/selfie-examples.png">
</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>Please take a moment right now</strong>
</span> to stand with us through your <a href="https://secure.parentalrights.org/np/clients/parentalrights/donation.jsp?campaign=51" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-link-type="web" data-segment-action="add" data-segment-id="ac7b6ce0-a4a1-11e8-b45d-d4ae5292c2ac">
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">donation to ParentalRights.org</span>.</a> And then multiply your investment (again!) by posting your “family heart selfie” and asking your friends and family to give as well.</p>
<h2>Free Incentives for Those Who Give!</h2>
<p>We’re even offering a few free incentives for those who give.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, we’re giving away 5 free ParentalRights.org bundles (including our popular mugs) throughout the day to randomly chosen donors who give through our online donation form. (We’ll give away one from each stop on our road trip, and one in our wrap-up report Wednesday morning.)</li>
<li>Second, we’re offering a special gift for the highest donation we receive from Pennsylvania. Watch for Pennsylvania State Coordinator Vickie Suarez to go <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/parentalrights.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-link-type="web">live with Maggie from Harrisburg</a>
</span> this afternoon (around 2 or 2:30) for more details.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Follow the #GTRoadTrip Live on Facebook!</h2>
<p>We invite all of you to follow us online, as Maggie and Shellby, along with some surprise guests, will be going <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/parentalrights.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-link-type="web">live on Facebook</a>
</span> from various stops on our #GTRoadTrip throughout the day to keep you updated on our campaign.</p>
<p>There’s no better time to support the protection of our children through the Parental Rights Amendment than right now, so <a href="https://secure.parentalrights.org/np/clients/parentalrights/donation.jsp?campaign=51" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-link-type="web" data-segment-action="add" data-segment-id="ac7b6ce0-a4a1-11e8-b45d-d4ae5292c2ac">
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">give today!</span>

<strong>up to 83% of children taken from their homes by the government this year were removed on allegations that ultimately proved unfounded or unsubstantiated.</strong> </span>Studies consistently show that children fare better in their own homes with their own parents, but states continue to remove more than five times as many children as are actually abused.</p>
<p>That’s why we’re continuing to fight for the Parental Rights Amendment, and for changes in state and federal law that will keep families together.</p>

</a>So this <a href="https://parentalrights.org/givingtuesday/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-link-type="web">
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Giving Tuesday</span>
</a> (November 27), our own <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>Maggie and Shellby are taking a GT Road Trip to multiple state capitals</strong>
</span> to draw attention to the cause.</p>
<p>In automobile parlance, a GT, from the Italian gran turismo, is a luxury performance car built for high speeds over long distances. That’s not the kind of Road Trip we have planned. (Sorry, Maggie.)</p>
<p>In our case <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>GT stands for <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://parentalrights.org/givingtuesday/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-link-type="web">#GivingTuesday</a>
</strong>
</span>, the new and growing social media holiday that closes out the Thanksgiving Season with donations to your favorite cause or charity.</p>
<h2>
<img src="https://parentalrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/capital-pa-270x300.png">We’re Heading to Three State Capitals…and You Can Join in Live!</h2>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>We’re planning fun giveaways and other events throughout the day</strong>
</span>, and the ladies will be reporting in via Facebook Live from Dover, Delaware; Annapolis, Maryland; and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, before finishing out the drive back here at our Virginia office.</p>
<p>They’ll be joined along the way by some exciting surprise guests, too.</p>
<h2>Goal: To Raise Both Awareness and $20,000</h2>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>Our goal is to raise awareness for the need to protect parental rights, as well as $20,000</strong>
</span> in one day to fuel support for vital parental rights efforts in the upcoming legislative session both in Congress and in the several states.</p>
<h2>Every Dollar Counts Double!</h2>
<p>What’s more, thanks to generous matching grants, every dollar will count double, right up to the $20,000 goal.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>It’s the one day this year you can give $2 to ParentalRights.org with only $1 coming out of your bank account.</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>So as you plan your giving, plan to protect children by empowering parents with your generous donation to ParentalRights.org.</p>
<p>Then tell your friends and get ready to follow Maggie and Shellby’s GT Road Trip progress on Facebook or Twitter (#GTRoadTrip).</p>
<p>Be part of the giving on November 27!</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Dear Champion of Parental Rights,</p>
<p>ParentalRights.org recently sent a letter to President Trump on your behalf. The following explains how that unusual event came about and what it means.</p>
<p>When a Norwegian family court in September ruled to terminate Amy Jakobsen’s parental rights to Tyler, her son, friends, and legal advisors went looking for additional help. And they came to ParentalRights.org.</p>
<p>You may have seen the story in our <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
<a href="https://parentalrights.org/child-kidnapped-in-norway/">email</a>
</span> or on our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/parentalrights.org/posts/10156741283258748">
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">social media posts</span>
</a>. Amy, an American citizen, lost custody of her son for no other reason than that she was still breastfeeding him at 19 months. He had shown no interest yet in solid food, so Amy let him continue to nurse while she carefully monitored his weight. At a pediatric appointment which (perhaps significantly) immediately followed her return to Norway from a visit to the U.S. with her son, the boy weighed 9.6 kg, barely below the “ideal” weight of 10.0 kg.</p>
<p>That’s still in the acceptable range; the difference is less than a pound. But it was enough for Barnevernet, Norway’s child protection agency, to accuse Amy of neglect and take her son.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>Now, five years later, a court has terminated Amy’s parental rights and she has lost her son forever.</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>No other accusations have been added and no charges were ever filed. And while it might have been understandable under the circumstances, Amy never lost her cool in the courtroom or make irrational threats of violence against government officials. She was just a good mom trying to take care of her son.</p>
<p>Tyler, an American citizen himself, has been held by the government of Norway for the past five years.</p>
<p>When Amy’s lawyers and friends started looking for international assistance, for pressure from her homeland, they turned to ParentalRights.org. And thanks to partners like you, we were able to step up and add our collective voice to Amy’s plea for justice.</p>
<p>International matters are not a normal part of our focus. We work to protect children by empowering American parents, usually right here in America, through the Parental Rights Amendment, and through state and federal statutes.</p>
<p>But this “international matter” posed a unique situation. Amy and Tyler are American citizens whose right to be a family has been stolen. <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>And there is no other nationwide organization solely focused on standing up for the parental rights of American citizens.</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>Amy and her friends knew this. That’s why they urged us to share Amy’s story here in America, which we were happy to do.</p>
<p>Other organizations knew this, too, and a few days later they asked us to pen a letter to the White House on Amy’s behalf.</p>
<p>You see, your partnership with us through the years is having an effect we don’t often look for or highlight: you have empowered us to build a name for ourselves. And when I say “for ourselves,” I don’t mean for this organization alone.</p>
<p>I mean for the entire parental rights movement this organization’s name has come to represent.</p>
<p>I mean the collective voice for parental rights that you and I raise together all the time.</p>
<p>
<em>Thanks to you</em>, we have seen statutes passed in nearly a dozen states to solidify the role of parents in the lives of their children.</p>
<p>
<em>Thanks to you</em>, we have educated countless lawmakers who believed in parental rights but didn’t realize how much these rights are threatened today.</p>
<p>
<em>Thanks to you</em>, we were invited to form a new bipartisan coalition to take on the injustices funded by federal tax dollars through laws like the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act and the Adoption and Safe Families Act that give incentives for state governments to abuse or ignore the legal rights of parents, something we are working to change.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>
<em>Thanks to you</em>, we have become an effective, respected organization so that when a family in Norway needed a voice for parental rights back home in the States, they knew to reach out to ParentalRights.org.</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>And when other organizations aware of this international case saw that someone needed to alert the President to what’s going on, <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>they believed the name of ParentalRights.org—<em>rather than their own name!</em>—should be on that letter.</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>Frankly, a letter to the President in a case like this is a “Hail Mary,” a last, desperate effort. It is possible the President could instruct the State Department to file a complaint with their contacts in Norway. They could recognize this matter for what it is—an American citizen taken by a foreign power without legal cause.</p>
<p>Our letter could also end up as just one more cry for help among many the Administration receives.</p>
<p>But <em>thanks to you</em>, ParentalRights.org was honored to be the organization throwing that “Hail Mary” pass.</p>
<p>Our list of friends and allies—which continues to grow in all corners of the political spectrum—<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>is recognizing us as a “go-to” name in defending America’s parental rights.</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #1c8296;">
<strong>And that is all because of you.</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>Your <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
<a href="https://secure.parentalrights.org/np/clients/parentalrights/donation.jsp?campaign=5&amp;">past partnership</a>
</span> has fueled all the seemingly small efforts that have helped us to build a big reputation.</p>
<p>And if the President steps in and helps Tyler come home, that will be because of you as well.</p>
<p>Your <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
<a href="https://secure.parentalrights.org/np/clients/parentalrights/donation.jsp?campaign=5&amp;">faithful partnership</a>
</span> helps American families, both in the present and into the future.</p>
<p>While we have made great progress, gaining a solid reputation and becoming internationally recognized as the best voice for parents’ rights, many families still suffer because their rights are not protected by the U.S. Constitution. As an organization, we have much work to do; we must keep this important mission moving forward.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #1c8296;">
<strong>But we can’t do any of this without your support.</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>Would you consider <a href="https://secure.parentalrights.org/np/clients/parentalrights/donation.jsp?campaign=5&amp;">
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">giving your best gift of $25, $50, $75, or even $150 today?</span>
</a>
</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>It is only through the generous support of partners like you that we have built up the name and reputation we now have, a name that lets us speak up for America’s families in trouble.</p>
<p>Can you take a moment today to <a href="https://secure.parentalrights.org/np/clients/parentalrights/donation.jsp?campaign=5&amp;">
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">
<strong>invest once more</strong>
</span>
</a> and keep our name and effort going strong?</p>
<p>Gratefully,</p>

<strong>BREAKING:</strong>
</span> In a recent development, four European nations sent letters to Norway shortly after our own letter went to the White House. Belgium, Bulgaria, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic issued formal complaints, just as we have requested of our own Administration, against the injustices Barnevernet has inflicted on innocent families.</p>
<p>P.S. – Thank you for all you have done. <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>Your interest, support, and encouragement over the years has enabled us to make a name for ourselves that can make a difference for families like Amy’s.</strong> </span>A letter to the President is no small thing, and it is <a href="https://secure.parentalrights.org/np/clients/parentalrights/donation.jsp?campaign=5&amp;">
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">your partnership</span>

<em>Editor's note: The email version of this article said "It's time to call Congress." That was an error; instead, it is time for Resolutionary volunteers to contact state lawmakers. Read on for details.</em>
</span>
</p>
<p>It may take some time for the dust to settle on the 2018 mid-term elections, as some races are still too close to call this morning, but a few things are clear even this early. <span style="color: #1c8296;">
<strong>Here are six big takeaways regarding the election and your parental rights.</strong> </span>(If you’re short on time, be sure you at least read #4.)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong> The U.S. House of Representatives will be led by Democrats in 2019.</strong>
</span> Though the exact number of seats for each party is still uncertain due to a few closely contested races, the Democrats have already won a majority of seats, which will bring a change of leadership for the entire chamber and every one of its committees.</li>
<li>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong> The U.S. Senate will remain under Republican leadership for the next two years.</strong> </span>Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who has championed the PRA in the Senate for the last six years, is in position to continue to do so.</li>
<li>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong> The Parental Rights Amendment (PRA) will get a new lead sponsor in the House.</strong> </span>Current lead sponsor Rep. Randy Hultgren (R-IL) lost his reelection bid. We certainly appreciate Rep. Hultgren and his leadership, and we wish him and his family all the best in whatever opportunity comes next for them.</li>
<li>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong> None of this forces any change in our course.</strong> </span>We have already identified and contacted another congressman to take up the mantle in the House, so our efforts won’t be slowed there. More significantly, unless one party were able to achieve an unprecedented two-thirds majority in both parties (290 in the House, 67 in the Senate), passing the PRA was always going to require support from members of both houses. Not surprisingly, this year’s election hasn’t changed that, either.</li>
<li>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong> Races all over the country—not just in Congress—have now been decided.</strong> </span>Republican, Democrat, or Independent, we can now know who will be holding office in January in your state senate and assembly or house. That means…</li>
<li>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong> Our Resolutionary Campaign is ready to move to the next phase.</strong>
</span>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>
<span style="color: #1c8296;">
<strong>Resolutionary Campaign “Full Speed Ahead”</strong>
</span>
</h2>
<p>In the early weeks, we connected with new and existing volunteers to plan PRA resolutions in their states. We sent model resolution language for each state legislature to consider in the coming session.</p>
<p>But we couldn’t effectively get the model language to lawmakers until we knew which ones will take office and which ones have been voted out. As of this morning, those questions are answered; we can move forward once again.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>
<img src="https://parentalrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/drums-300x288.png">If you are one of those <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
<a href="https://parentalrights.org/resolutionary/">Resolutionary</a>
</span> volunteers and you’ve been waiting to approach your lawmakers,</strong> </span>now is the time to contact your own state senator or assemblyman/ representative and ask them if they will sponsor the resolution <em>or can recommend someone who will.</em> Consider the make-up of your legislature, whether it makes more sense to seek a Republican or Democrat to lead the charge, because <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>parental rights is <em>not</em> a partisan issue!</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>If you are not yet a volunteer but would like to take an active role in your state, email <a href="mailto:Michael@parentalrights.org">Michael@parentalrights.org</a> with the subject line “Resolutionary” and I will help you get plugged in. (If I get a lot of responses, it may take me a little while to get back to you; I appreciate your patience.)</p>
<p>To sum up, our plan all along has been to introduce the Parental Rights Amendment early in the 2019 Congress, and to introduce PRA resolutions in as many states as possible at the same time. Nothing in yesterday’s election results has changed our plans one bit. But removing the uncertainty lets us move forward today.</p>
<p>As we now look ahead to January, we are ready to go full speed ahead into this next great chapter to preserve your parental rights. Thank you for standing with us!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>We recently celebrated Michael’s ten years of dedicated service to the cause of parental rights and to the organization. You have no doubt seen his name on the weekly emails, which he writes. Many of you have had the opportunity to speak with him on the phone or to work with him in coordinating your volunteer efforts through the years as well.</p>
<p>In light of his dedication, expertise, and leadership ability, it was a logical step to promote him to executive director, a position I have held in an interim capacity for the last several months.</p>
<p>For the time being, Michael will continue to carry many of his previous duties. For instance, you will still be hearing from him in the weekly newsletter for the foreseeable future. But he will carry additional responsibilities as well, for which he could use your prayers.</p>
<p>Michael is up for the challenge, and I expect the organizations will achieve much in the coming months and years with your continued, faithful support.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<em>From new Executive Director Michael Ramey:</em>
</h2>
<p>Dear Champion of Parental Rights,</p>
<p>It has been an honor and privilege to serve alongside you these last ten years in promoting parental rights and the Parental Rights Amendment. With my new assignment, I look forward to finding new and even better ways to work together to bring real and lasting change in our country to protect these rights and our families.</p>
<p>One thing I have learned as deputy director and director of communications: we truly could not have achieved anything without you. Your collective voice has been and remains the true strength of this organization.</p>
<p>I am excited about our ongoing Resolutionary Campaign, and about our upcoming Giving Tuesday effort, as well. And I am blessed with a wonderful team both here in the office and out there among (and including) all of you.</p>
<p>I appreciate each of you and am grateful we are on this journey together!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

</p>
<p>Two-day-old Paxton Meissinger was separated from his parents by the Arizona Department of Child Services (DCS), a victim not of abuse or neglect, but of his circumstances. His chances to nurse, to draw from his mother all the safety, warmth, and nourishment that lead experts to call his early months the “fourth trimester” have been stripped away, <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>based on false allegations from a medical system out of touch with scientific reality.</strong>
</span>
</p>
<h2>
<strong>Stolen Brothers</strong>
</h2>
<p>According to the story at <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
<a href="http://medicalkidnap.com/2018/10/21/arizona-parents-accused-of-abusing-vaccine-damaged-child-as-they-fight-for-his-return-arizona-kidnaps-their-48-hour-old-newborn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Medical Kidnap</a>
</span>, Paxton, who was born October 16, has a 16-month-old brother, Keaton, already in the custody of the state of Arizona. Parents Briana and Jordan may be days from bringing him home. But how much can the family rejoice in Keaton’s return (if he is returned) while the state is now holding Paxton?</p>
<p>In 2017, just after his two-month shots, Keaton suffered a life-threatening infection. Doctors at Banner Del Webb Hospital immediately started him on three strong antibiotics, then transferred him to Phoenix Children’s Hospital for a lumbar puncture. That’s where the family’s troubles began.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>Despite the clear evidence and professional medical diagnosis that his symptoms,</strong>
</span> which were rapidly clearing with the administration of antibiotics, were caused by the bacterial infection, Child Abuse Pediatrician Cynthia Nelson at Phoenix Children’s found what is ominously called “the triad” —three symptoms which, taken together, can be used to accuse a parent of “Shaken Baby Syndrome” (SBS). <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>The hospital called DCS, who took Keaton from his parents.</strong> </span>The case has dragged on for a year through court delays and run-arounds.</p>
<p>When Paxton was born, a new anonymous call claimed the baby had been born 8 days prior, and that his parents were hiding him from DCS at their home. In reality, the baby was two days old and his mother, who had delivered him by C-section, was still in the hospital recovering. Yet, while the phoned-in allegation was demonstrably false, DCS got a warrant anyway and took the second Meissinger child.</p>
<p>After all, if the parents shook his older brother nearly to death, aren’t extreme measures needed to protect this child from becoming a victim of SBS as well?</p>
<h2>
<strong>Junk Science Diagnosis</strong>
</h2>
<p>In her 2014 book, <em>Flawed Convictions: “Shaken Baby Syndrome” and the Inertia of Injustice</em>, Deborah Tuerkheimer of Noerthwestern University School of Law exposes the circular reasoning behind this discredited diagnosis. The logic goes like this: Because SBS is a medical diagnosis, the only person qualified to testify to it in courts is the Child Abuse Pediatrician. A physicist may point out that shaking sufficient to cause this damage would snap the child’s neck, but he is not a doctor; what does he know? Another doctor may testify that the triad was caused by a virus or by a bacterial infection (as in Keaton’s case); but is <em>he </em>an expert in child abuse trauma? Of course not. So his testimony is invalid in this child abuse case.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>For years courts adopted a judgment of guilt based on the pediatrician’s diagnosis,</strong> </span>treating the doctor as an arbiter of guilt rather than a diagnostician of illness or injury. The courts became rubber stamps on the word of a doctor whose very career field depends on the hypothetical ability to diagnose guilt. As a result, on average 1,000 defendants were sentenced on charges of SBS every year from 1996 and 2006.</p>
<p>But in recent years, the tide has begun to turn, even to the point of seeing convictions overturned. The SBS diagnosis simply doesn’t hold up to scientific scrutiny. Courts of appeal have begun to recognize that if the science upon which the entire conviction is based has been overturned, the conviction itself must likewise be reversed. (See, for instance, <em>State v. Edmonds</em>, 2008 WI App33, 746 N.W.2d 590.)</p>
<p>Unfortunately, <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>Arizona has been slow to get the memo.</strong> </span>Doctors now conclude that the diagnosis with which Nelson accused the Meissingers of abuse has no underpinnings in science. Too many other possible causes for the triad exist according to Tuerkheimer, including a bacterial infection such as meningitis or encephalitis, either of which would have fit the family’s experience with Keaton.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>Sadly, too many courts are still rubberstamping diagnoses rooted in junk science because a “child abuse pediatrician” says so.</strong>
</span> And without strong legal support for parental rights, there would be little anyone could do about it.</p>
<h2>
<strong>What We Can Do</strong>
</h2>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>But there are two things we can do.</strong> </span>We can fight to raise the level of legal respect accorded to parental rights. And we can work to bring awareness to the cause and to the plight of families like the Meissingers.</p>
<p>Our <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
<a href="https://parentalrights.org/resolutionary/">Resolutionary Campaign</a> </span>is designed to serve both purposes: it will push the propose Parental Rights Amendment forward in Congress (which will demand legal respect for parental rights) and draw attention to the cause at the state and local level.</p>
<p>So please <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>take a moment today to spread the word,</strong>
</span> perhaps by sharing this email, commenting on our Facebook page, or simply telling a friend. Consider volunteering to promote a resolution in your state. And <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #cc7700;">
<strong>
<a style="color: #cc7700; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://secure.parentalrights.org/np/clients/parentalrights/donation.jsp?campaign=5&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">give</a>
</strong>
</span> as you are able to continue this worthy cause.</p>
<p>Little boys like Paxton and Keaton belong in the arms of their parents, not squashed under the thumb of unnecessary state intervention. Step up today and help put an end to these abuses of the system.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<![CDATA[<p>A hospital in Toronto has proposed that doctors should have the authority to <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>euthanize minor patients without even a word to the parents.</strong>
</span> [News source: <a href="https://www.liveaction.org/news/assisted-suicide-children-canada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sick children in Canada may soon be euthanized without parental consent</a>.]<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>
<br>
</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>An end-of-life decision for a terminally ill child must be heart-wrenching, a parent’s worst nightmare. But can you imagine learning—after the fact—that your child’s doctor has already taken that from you? <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>You’ve had no time to work through the terrible news, no chance to say, “Goodbye.”</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>According to the policy proposed by the University of Toronto’s Joint Centre for Bioethics in the British Medical Journal’s Med Ethics, that would become a reality. In the decision-making flowchart included with the study, <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>no assisted suicide discussion occurs with parents until a “reflection period” after the child has already been killed.</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>Under current Canadian law adopted in 2016, “capable patients” 18 years of age or older can opt for assisted suicide. This new policy would make that option available to “capable” children, as well. A child of 15 or 16 could opt for assisted suicide and instruct the physician not to alert her parents until after the fact, a request the doctors would be bound to honor under confidentiality laws.</p>
<p>The danger if there should be fraud in the system is tremendous. Who is to stop a hospital from terminating the life of a young patient against the patient’s will, if there are no parents in the mix to protect the child’s interests? It’s easy enough after the fact to claim consent from one who is no longer there to say otherwise.</p>
<p>But even with safeguards in place, this policy still places vulnerable children—even mature children—in a terribly awkward spot. As the Supreme Court declared in <em>Parham v. J.R.</em>, 442 US 584 (1979), “Most children, even in adolescence, simply are not able to make sound judgments concerning many decisions, including their need for medical care or treatment. Parents can and must make those judgments.”</p>
<p>How much more is this true when the decision is literally life-and-death?</p>
<p>As any loving parent will tell you, it is not enough to ask whether my child could make that decision on her own. The fact is she should never have to. That’s just the kind of heavy lifting I’m here to face with them.</p>
<p>Yet Toronto University <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>seems bent on cutting parents out of the child’s life just when that child needs a parent the most,</strong> </span>robbing both parent and child of their final hours, days, or even months together.</p>
<p>Fortunately, this is only a policy proposal; it is not yet law, even in Canada. And it is even further removed from becoming the law here.</p>
<p>But now that “biomedical ethicists” have broached the subject (they argue that since Ontario laws do not require a parent’s permission for a child to refuse treatment, they should not require permission to end a child’s life, either), the proverbial genie cannot be put back in the bottle. <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>It is only a matter of time before it is adopted somewhere and eventually makes its way here.</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">That is, unless we act to stop it. Which we can.<br>
<a name="action">
</a>
</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">
<span style="color: #1c8296;">
<strong>***Action Items***</strong>
</span>
</h2>
<p>The proposed Parental Rights Amendment to the U.S. Constitution would protect the right of parents to direct the care of their minor children. This raises a tremendous legal barrier to those who want to snatch authority away from parents and give it to medical personnel.</p>
<p>And you can help us get the Amendment adopted.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">First, you can volunteer for the</span> <a href="https://parentalrights.org/resolutionary/">
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Resolutionary Campaign</span>
</a>,</strong> our effort to introduce in your state a legislative resolution calling on Congress to promote the Amendment. Since our <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
<a href="https://parentalrights.org/2019-battle-plan/">email introducing the campaign four weeks ago</a>
</span>, we’ve heard from dozens of volunteers across the country ready to step up and help. You can join them by emailing <a href="mailto:Michael@ParentalRights.org">Michael@ParentalRights.org</a> and using “Resolutionary” as the subject line. Let me know what state you’re in, and I can point you in the right direction to get started.</li>
<li>Second, you can<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong> fuel the campaign—and our ongoing work to pass the Amendment—with your <a href="https://parentalrights.org/resolutionary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">generous donation.</span>
</a>
</strong>
</span> We depend entirely on donors just like you to fund our efforts to educate the public and policy makers about this important issue.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before us lies a brave new world where you can take your sick teen to the hospital and come home with just a box of his belongings. But <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>we can stop it from coming and preserve those final moments—and those momentous decisions—for families to face as one.</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>Together we can secure the Parental Rights Amendment and protect families even in their most fragile moments like these.</p>
<p>Thank you for your ongoing support.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<![CDATA[<p>
<em>[Photo from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=197&amp;v=9AayHOtZWp8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Step up 4 Children’s Rights YouTube video.</a>] </em>
</p>
<p>This week, Amy Jakobsen received news every loving parent dreads: the courts have officially “released” her son “for adoption.”</p>
<p>Amy is an American citizen who was living in Norway in July of 2013, when her troubles all began.</p>
<h2>Amy’s Story</h2>
<p>As a first-time mother, Amy grew concerned when her son, Tyler, was a little below the growth curve at his checkup. He didn’t seem ready to move to solid food yet and was content to continue breast feeding exclusively. As a concerned mother, Amy “took Tyler for medical check-ups three times a month in order to monitor the growth process very closely,” according to an article at <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
<a href="https://stepup4childrensrights.com/breastfeeding-not-allowed-the-case-of-amy-j/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">StepUp4ChildrensRights.com</a>
</span>.</p>
<p>When summer came, Amy continued to monitor the 19-month-old’s health, while taking him on a two-week vacation to America. (Tyler was born in Norway.) She never imagined that as soon as she returned she would be facing the police and Norway’s child welfare service, the “Barnevernet.”</p>
<p>(The word “barnevernet” literally means “child protection,” though their reputation or a quick internet search might reasonably lead one to guess it was Norwegian for “Gestapo.”)</p>
<p>The case workers demanded that Tyler be taken immediately to the hospital for an examination, where they found that his weight was 9.6 kg—lower than the ideal weight for his age of 10 kg, but still within the acceptable range. (For those unfamiliar with kilograms, this is a difference of <em>less than a pound!</em>) But this slightly lower weight, combined with a doctor’s criticism that Amy was still breastfeeding, was enough for the Barnevernet to sweep the boy away from his mother, ultimately forever.</p>
<p>Faced with the loss of his son, Tyler’s father, Kevin, snuck into the hospital dressed as a doctor and was able to remove his son. With no other plan, and the Barnevernet breathing down his neck, all he could do was drive aimlessly for a few extra hours with his baby before police caught him and took his son back for good. Neither parent has seen Tyler since September 2014.</p>
<p>Since that time, the boy’s name has been changed twice to keep his parents from finding out where he is. Kevin is considered an abduction risk for the extra time he spent with his son, and Amy has been labelled a risk simply because she is an American.</p>
<p>The parents and their many allies have exhausted every legal avenue in Norway to get Tyler home. The European Court of Human Rights recently urged (in an unrelated September 6 ruling) that child removal should only be a temporary measure, but <a href="https://freetyler.com/amys-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">even that opinion has been ignored by Norway’s courts.</span>
</a>
</p>
<p>And now the court has made its final ruling: Tyler will not be coming home. Barnevernet is free to give him away to someone else.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>No charge of abuse. No evidence of neglect. No offer of assistance or effort to keep the family intact.</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>Perhaps the trip to America back in 2013 made Barnevernet nervous that they might lose Tyler to the States. The organization certainly <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ap-norway-accused-of-unfairly-taking-away-immigrant-children-2015-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">has a history of taking children from foreign parents</span>
</a> just as they are preparing to leave the country. (It is also under investigation for numerous parental rights and human rights violations and for <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-45637040" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">additional forms of corruption</span>
</a>.)</p>
<h2>Don’t Let It Happen Here!</h2>
<p>This is what unchecked power in the “child welfare” system looks like. There are places one can find this in American today, as well. But if we don’t want to see it in the everyday as in Norway—even more, if we would see it stopped altogether—<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>we must <a href="https://secure.parentalrights.org/np/clients/parentalrights/donation.jsp?campaign=5&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stand now to preserve parental rights and halt the erosion of our families and our rights</a>.</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>That’s where ParentalRights.org comes in.</strong>
</span> We are working with a bipartisan coalition to change the federal laws that influence how our own child welfare organizations operate. And we are working on the ultimate solution, the Parental Rights Amendment (PRA) to the U.S. Constitution.</p>
<p>By demanding constitutional respect for and protection of parents’ fundamental rights to raise their children (and a child’s corresponding right to his parent’s protection), <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>the proposed PRA will make certain the tactics used by the Barnevernet never become commonplace in the United States as they have in Norway.</strong> </span>By putting these protections in the text of the U.S. Constitution, we can ensure they will protect parents in every state, and that they will endure for generations to come.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://secure.parentalrights.org/np/clients/parentalrights/donation.jsp?campaign=5&amp;">
<strong>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Please partner with us today</span>
</strong>
</a> to continue our effort to protect our children from the kind of “child protection” the Barnevernet stands for.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<strong>Here’s How You Can Help.</strong>
</span>
</span>
</center>As laid out in our <u>
<a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://secure.parentalrights.org/np/viewDocument?orgId=parentalrights&amp;id=4028e48c6570c2ac0165c46f90670200">2019 Battle Plan last week</a>
</u>, ParentalRights.org is looking to launch resolutions in as many states as possible—resolutions whereby your state lawmakers urge the 2019 Congress to pass the Parental Rights Amendment (PRA).<p>
</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>The plan is bold.</strong>
</span> It’s going to take a lot of work. But we believe it offers the best opportunity to get both sides of the aisle on board with the PRA.</p>
<p>The thing is, <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>we’re going to need your help</strong>
</span> to do it.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style="color: #1c8296;">
<strong>VOLUNTEER. </strong>
</span>ParentalRights.org has only a small staff in a Northern Virginia office. We don’t have personnel in every state to talk to lawmakers and get these resolutions introduced. What we do have, but need more of, are amazing volunteers willing to take model language we can provide and get it in front of the lawmakers in their states.You may be tempted to think you couldn’t do that because you’ve never done it before. I can tell you: <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<b>some of our best, most seasoned volunteers started exactly where you are right now.</b> </span>They took our model language, made a couple of phone calls, and next thing you know they were meeting with lawmakers and seeing bills or resolutions passed in their states. If they could do it, you can, too!If you are interested in this role, please email <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="mailto:Michael@parentalrights.org?subject=Resolutionary">Michael@parentalrights.org</a> and put “Resolutionary” in the subject line. Let me know any pertinent facts—whether you’re friends with a lawmaker, you’ve done this sort of thing before, or you’re completely new at it and have never spoken to your representative. <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<b>And be sure to identify which state you are in.</b>
</span>
</li>
<li>
<span style="color: #1c8296;">
<strong>SPREAD THE WORD &amp; STAY TUNED. </strong>
</span>If you are certain this is not your cup of tea, there will be other opportunities to contribute as the campaign unfolds. We will need to spread the word, to grow our network in each state so more supporters are available to call on lawmakers to do the right thing. State networks will grow to the point that some organization is needed. In some places an actual state structure may even emerge. So if you can’t pitch in today, <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<b>your opportunity may still be on the way.</b>
</span>
</li>
<li>
<span style="color: #1c8296;">
<strong>DONATE. </strong>
</span>As all of this takes money to coordinate, <u>
<a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://secure.parentalrights.org/np/clients/parentalrights/donation.jsp?campaign=50" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
<b>your donation today could make a real difference.</b>
</a>
</u>
</li>
</ul>
<p>However you choose to get plugged in, I thank you for standing with us to promote and protect parental rights. Together we can protect our families by passing the Parental Rights Amendment!</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Dear Champion of Parental Rights,</p>
<p>I have some exciting news from the board of ParentalRights.org, and I wanted to share it with our most faithful supporters right away.</p>
<p>Our board recently held a planning retreat and came away more passionate and focused than ever. Together the board and my staff planned and laid the foundation for an exciting new push for the Parental Rights Amendment in the coming 2019 Congress, and <u>
<b>
<a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://parentalrights.org/resolutionary/">the time for us to start it is now</a>
</b>
</u>.</p>
<p>So right now we are looking for “<u>
<a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://parentalrights.org/resolutionary-2017/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Resolutionaries</a>
</u>.”</p>
<p>We are already working with members of Congress to introduce the Parental Rights Amendment (PRA) in the House and Senate as early as possible in January 2019. That will also enable us to introduce PRA resolutions in a number of <i>states</i> starting immediately after that. “Resolutionaries” are those who, through time or money, empower these resolutions in the states.</p>
<p>State resolutions provide a way for your state legislature to put pressure on your delegation in the U.S. Congress to sign on as cosponsors of the Parental Rights Amendment, so our aim is to see as many of them introduced and adopted as possible during the 2019 session.</p>
<p>We know from earlier efforts what these resolutions can do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resolutions can provide a focus around which to grow and sharpen our grassroots base.</li>
<li>They provide an opportunity for both parties to show support for parental rights, something we are not yet seeing in Congress.</li>
<li>They apply pressure; as the number of states climbs, so does the sense that Congress <i>needs to act</i> as the states demand.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find a one-page summary of the Battle Plan at <u>
<a style="color: #cc7700;" href="http://ParentalRights.org/Resolutionary">ParentalRights.org/Resolutionary</a>
</u> and see for yourself how it is laid out and how it’s intended to work. But it will require generous support from our partners.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<b>Thank you for faithfully standing for parental rights.</b>
</span> And if you can invest in the launch of this new campaign with a <u>
<a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://secure.parentalrights.org/np/clients/parentalrights/donation.jsp?campaign=50" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generous donation today</a>
</u>, we certainly would appreciate that as well. Regardless, we look forward to championing the PRA with you in the 2019 Congress.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>
<img src="https://secure.parentalrights.org/neon/resource/parentalrights/images/Mason-signature-1.png">
<br>
P.S. – Amending the Constitution is a marathon broken up into a series of two-year sprints: each session must build on the last until the Amendment can be introduced and passed in a single Congress. January 2019, is the start of our next sprint. Early introduction, with state-based support through resolutions, will be key. <u>
<b>
<a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://secure.parentalrights.org/np/clients/parentalrights/donation.jsp?campaign=50">Please partner with us as you are able to support this important campaign.</a>

<![CDATA[<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>Today is the first day Congress is in session since the start of the August Recess more than a month ago.</strong>
</span> And while the confirmation hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the Senate Judiciary Committee will be grabbing all the headlines, today is an important day in the House, as well.</p>
<p>That’s because, as the first day the House is in session in over a month,<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong> today is the first chance in weeks that your congressman has to sign on</strong>
</span> as a cosponsor of H.J. Res. 121, the <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://parentalrights.org/amendment/">Parental Rights Amendment (PRA)</a>.</p>
<p>You may recall that <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://parentalrights.org/tag/dcblitzday/">our staff went to D.C. at the end of June to visit several congressmen and lobby with them on your behalf</a> to support the PRA, which is led by Rep. Randy Hultgren (R-IL) in the House (and Sen. Lindsey Graham in the Senate).  But their offices were busy with a lot of pressing bills throughout July, so that many did not have the bandwidth to look at our proposal and sign on as cosponsors.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #1c8296;">
<strong>Now it is time to get them signed on.</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>Please take a moment today to call your Congressman</strong>
</span> and urge him or her to sign on with Rep. Hultgren as a cosponsor of H.J. Res. 121, the Parental Rights Amendment. (And if you got this too late to call Tuesday, call on Wednesday. Or even Thursday. But please call as soon as you can!) You can find your congressman’s contact information on <a href="https://secure.parentalrights.org/track//servlet/DisplayLink?orgId=parentalrights&amp;&lt;&lt;emailTrackingId&gt;&gt;&amp;&lt;&lt;secureId&gt;&gt;&amp;linkId=24419&amp;targetUrl=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/map" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GovTrack</a>, or call the Capitol Switchboard at 202-224-3121.</p>
<ol>
<li>You will almost certainly talk to a staff member and not your actual congressional representative. Be courteous but clear, asking your representative to sign on as a cosponsor to the Parental Rights Amendment, H.J. Res. 121, with Rep. Hultgren of Illinois.</li>
<li>If you’d like to add some of the reasoning behind your decision to support the Amendment, that will help them, too.</li>
<li>You might also mention that, while it’s unlikely the PRA will be passed this Congress (which ends in a couple of months), their support in this tangible way can only help them on their reelection efforts this November. Public opinion polls show support for parental rights at over 90%, regardless of political party affiliation.</li>
<li>Lastly, some offices will also require you to give them your address so they can confirm you live in the congressman’s district.</li>
</ol>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>Thank you for taking a few minutes out of your busy day today</strong>
</span> to raise your voice with ours for the cause of our families and our parental rights!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Dear Champion of Parental Rights,</p>
<p>Heartbreaking. Unjust. Shameful.</p>
<p>These are just a few of the words that come to mind when I consider the shocking violation of parental rights in our country.</p>
<ul>
<li>I think of a three-year-old Colorado girl who was strip-searched while attending day-care, without a warrant and without her mother’s knowledge. The Federal District Court for Colorado ruled that the mother’s right to be informed and give consent was not a clearly established constitutional right, and neither was her daughter’s right to bodily privacy. With your help, the Parental Rights Foundation got involved by filing a “friend of the court” brief to highlight the painful fact that intrusions like this irreparably and unnecessarily damage children and families. However, the damage to this young girl and her mother can never be reversed.</li>
<li>I think of teen Justina Pelletier, placed in the custody of Boston Children’s Hospital because their doctors disagreed with the diagnosis of the girl’s <em>family doctor.</em> It took sixteen months for Justina to be returned to her fit and loving parents. By then her health had greatly deteriorated, and sadly she has yet to recover (if she ever will). The State of Massachusetts caused great physical, mental, and emotional damage to this girl and her family by removing Justina from her parents’ care.</li>
<li>I think of the 14 children from Georgia who were separated from their parents for up to 148 days when they made an emergency stop on the way home from a church conference. Without any evidence or justification, a Mississippi child services investigator accused the parents of “child trafficking” when some of the kids decided to raise money for their church dance team. That one over-zealous allegation took 148 days to unravel, and while the Parental Rights Foundation has sued on behalf of those families the truth is that even if we win the families will never be the same.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>But these are just a few of the thousands of families CPS unnecessarily investigates each year. According to federal data, some 83% of all such investigations ultimately prove unfounded or unsubstantiated. </strong>
</span>That’s roughly 7 out of every 8.</p>
<p>This spring, an international outcry arose from an Associated Press report that roughly 2,000 children had been separated from their families by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) between April and June.</p>
<p>The world was shocked that 2,000 immigrant children were separated from their parents in a span of two months. <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>But they’re ignoring the fact that 2,000 American children are taken from their families <em>every three days.</em>
</strong>
</span>
</p>
<hr style="height: 1px; border: none; color: #1c8296; background-color: #1c8296;">
<p>
<span style="color: #1c8296;">
<strong>Every Three Days.</strong>
</span>
<br>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>Every three days, 2,000 children are taken from the safety of their home. </strong>
</span>Every three days, 2,000 children are ripped from the loving arms of their parents. Every three days, 2,000 children lose their sense of security, the belief that their parents can protect them from anything.</p>
<p>Roughly half of the children removed from their homes will eventually be returned, but even when they are the damage has been done. Many of these children will suffer from depression and other mental illnesses later in life. Studies have shown that children who spend time in foster care will have higher rates of teen pregnancy, lower graduation rates, and higher rates of incarceration into adulthood. In short, even after the child is returned, neither they nor their families will ever be the same.</p>
<p>It took<em> nearly two months</em> for CBP to interfere in the lives of 2,000 children, but Child Protective Services (CPS) irreparably damages the same number of children <em>every three days.</em>
</p>
<p>Current legal protections for families are simply insufficient to keep CPS from taking our children from innocent homes.</p>
<p>We know parents have the right to care for their child before anyone else. The law has traditionally assumed that most fit parents know what is best for their child. Our current system, however, gives the government too much power to easily infringe upon these parental rights. Courts too often violate and ignore your right to care for your child, giving that power instead to total strangers. While no parent has a right to abuse or neglect a child, every fit parent has the right to care for, love, and protect their child.</p>
<p>Likewise, every child has the right to be cared for and loved by their own fit and loving parents.</p>
<hr style="height: 1px; border: none; color: #1c8296; background-color: #1c8296;">
<p>
<span style="color: #1c8296;">
<strong>It Is for This Very Reason That American Parents—Like You and Me—Need the Constitutional Protection of the Parental Rights Amendment.</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>With your help and support, we have been fighting to secure these rights in the text of the Constitution. When it’s adopted, the Parental Rights Amendment will ensure that our parental rights receive the respect, legal protection, and due process they deserve.</p>
<p>Together, we have accomplished great things over the past few years. Because of your support, our online presence and visibility in Congress have grown as we continue to make our mission known and supported by more Americans.  With your help, we have reintroduced the Amendment in both houses of Congress. And now thanks to you we are starting to see additional cosponsors added to the Amendment’s list of supporters in Washington.</p>
<p>Our Founding Fathers understood that parental rights were inalienable; they couldn’t even imagine having to spell that out. And for decades our legal system agreed. In 2000, however, the Supreme Court’s decision in <em>Troxel v. Granville</em> introduced a new level of doubt and ambiguity: just how important are parental rights, and how much protection do they need? The Court’s splintered decision introduced a new ethereal standard of “some special weight” as the amount of respect your rights are due. It’s no wonder lower courts since then have been unable to sort out just how much—or how little—that might mean!</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>So here’s what we do: we fight to restore and protect our fundamental rights.</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>That is why my team went into Washington on Wednesday, June 27. In an effort to ensure that all our rights are protected, we talked with a number of congressional offices, making your lawmakers aware of the need for the Parental Rights Amendment. We made great progress and expect to see a number of these Congressmen agree to co-sponsor our Amendment when Congress reconvenes in September.</p>
<p>But we could only accomplish so much because of generous supporters like you.</p>
<p>On our D.C. Blitz Day, we were not alone in our efforts. Across the nation, many citizens just like you called their representatives’ offices and encouraged them to support the Parental Rights Amendment. Because of your efforts, we expect to see new cosponsors sign on soon.</p>
<p>Just as important were the people who <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
<a style="color: #cc7700; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://secure.parentalrights.org/np/clients/parentalrights/donation.jsp?campaign=5&amp;">donated</a>
</span> during the Blitz week and who have graciously continued to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
<a style="color: #cc7700; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://secure.parentalrights.org/np/clients/parentalrights/donation.jsp?campaign=5&amp;">donate</a>
</span> to ParentalRights.org over these past years. Your decision to partner with us has kept our organization alive and our efforts effective. To both our donors and our volunteers like you, we say, “Thank you for your faithful hard work!”</p>
<p>We have gotten Congress’s attention. We are opening their eyes to the families being separated right in their own back yards. But we need your continued support to spread the word to more concerned citizens, to drive the message home in Congress, and to make the necessary changes in our law.</p>
<p>The simple truth is that <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>without you, we will not be able to help any of these families.</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>Would you <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://secure.parentalrights.org/np/clients/parentalrights/donation.jsp?campaign=5&amp;">
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">partner with us</span>
</a> so that innocent parents will no longer have to live in fear of losing their children? With your generous donation today, we can continue to work toward keeping these families together.</p>
<p>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">
<a style="color: #cc7700; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://secure.parentalrights.org/np/clients/parentalrights/donation.jsp?campaign=5&amp;">
<strong>Won’t you give your best gift today?</strong>
</a>
</span>
</p>
<p>Thank you for standing with parents throughout our nation—parents just like you and me—as we fight for our parental rights.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<strong>Ken Calvert (CA-42) is now a cosponsor</strong>
</span> of H.J. Res. 121, the Parental Rights Amendment, in the U.S. House. With lead sponsor Randy Hultgren (IL-14), <span style="color: #1c8296;">
<strong>Calvert brings to 21 the total number of supporters in that chamber.</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>With your support, we engaged in a special Lobbying Day at the Capitol on June 27, and Rep. Calvert’s was one of the offices we visited at that time. So thank you to all of you who donated, followed us online, spread the word to your friends, or otherwise took part in the effort. This additional cosponsor is a direct result of your work.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #1c8296;">
<strong>What’s more, I don’t think he’ll be the last.</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>Congress has been so busy lately, it took Rep. Calvert three whole weeks to sign on, even though his staff was able to assure us of his support for parental rights when we visited on June 27. (Rep. Calvert has been a cosponsor of the PRA in earlier sessions of Congress, as well.)</p>
<p>That strongly suggests other members may also sign on, and just haven’t found the needed time to do so yet. Other members we visited in June also have cosponsored in the past, and we’re looking for them to do so again.</p>
<p>To get updates when new cosponsors sign on, visit our <a style="color: #1c8296;" href="https://www.facebook.com/parentalrights.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook page</a>, ‘like’ the page, and check back on occasion for the latest news. Or just continue to watch your emails and we’ll keep you posted right here.</p>
<p>If you’re able, <strong>
<a style="color: #1c8296;" href="https://secure.parentalrights.org/np/clients/parentalrights/donation.jsp?campaign=5&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
<span style="color: #1c8296;">give to continue our efforts</span>
</a>
<span style="color: #1c8296;"> to enlist cosponsors </span>
</strong>toward securing the Parental Rights Amendment to preserve these rights for ourselves and for our children. Please consider <a style="color: #1c8296;" href="https://secure.parentalrights.org/np/clients/parentalrights/donation.jsp?campaign=5&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partnering with us on a monthly basis.</a>
</p>
<p>Thank you so much for standing with us to promote parental rights. Together we will see many more victories like this in the days ahead.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

</p>
<p>Dear Parental Rights Supporter,</p>
<p>You have probably seen them before: those little frames or badges around someone’s Facebook profile picture to champion some group or cause. This week, we’re inviting you to use one we have created to further the cause of parental rights by spreading awareness of our effort together.</p>
<p>It works like this:</p>
<p>
<img src="https://secure.parentalrights.org/neon/resource/parentalrights/images/SmallerImages/ISupport%23ParentalRights.png">This Sunday, July 22, is Parents’ Day, and we’ve decided to honor the day by creating social buzz for parental rights <span style="color: #3d800d;">
<strong>using a Facebook badge. </strong>
</span>The badge simply says “I support #ParentalRights” and has a graphic of a family.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #3d800d;">
<strong>Please use the badge and encourage others to use it too for the week of Parents’ Day (July 16-22).</strong>
</span> Wearing the badge for the week is a simple but effective way to share this critical message and to tell the world that #ParentalRights matter to you!</p>
<p>Here’s how to use the badge:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click to update your profile picture.</li>
<li>Select “Add Frame.”</li>
<li>Search for “#ParentalRights.”</li>
<li>Select the badge and leave it on your profile through Parents’ Day.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you for using and promoting the badge—<span style="color: #3d800d;">
<strong>together, we can create awareness that #ParentalRights matter.</strong>

<![CDATA[<p>
<span style="color: #990033;">
<strong>It may be the rarest of all gifts in American politics today: any topic that can bring bipartisan support. </strong>
</span>Such is parental rights, which according to polling enjoys the support of more than 90% from any political party—Democrat, Republican, or Independent.</p>
<p>This gift of bipartisan agreement should apply equally to <u>
<a style="color: #990033;" href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/6233?r=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">H.R. 6233</a>
</u>, a bill newly introduced in the U.S. House by Rep. Gwen Moore (D-WI). <span style="color: #990033;">
<strong>The legislation, which is championed by the bipartisan parental rights coalition of which ParentalRights.org is proud to be a part, </strong>
</span>would “amend the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act [CAPTA] to ensure that child protective services systems do not permit the separation of children from parents on the basis of poverty.”</p>
<p>Every year, the greatest majority of child welfare investigations are opened and conducted over accusations not of abuse, but of “neglect.” Sadly, though, an undisclosed number of these “neglect” cases stem from the simple inability of a perfectly loving and fit parent to provide for all the needs of their child. These are not cases of negligence, but of poverty.</p>
<p>Up to 83% of all child welfare cases will be closed as “unsubstantiated” or “unfounded,” but not before the intrusive damage is done.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #990033;">
<strong>H.R. 6233 aims to address and correct this tragic abuse of our most vulnerable families.</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>The measure is very short—only 18 lines spanning 2 pages—but could have a significant impact on child welfare investigations in America.</p>
<p>By requiring states to “ensure…that no child is separated from the child’s parent for reason of poverty,” this CAPTA amendment would change the way states handle such cases. While the federal government does not govern such matters, it incentivizes them through such legislation; those states who do not have the required safeguards in place will no longer qualify for the federal monies on which they so heavily rely.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Utah earned our praise with the passage of a law to clarify that poverty does not constitute neglect. In such cases, Utah state agencies are now required to provide support services to help the family meet their needs without separating children from their parents.</p>
<p>This provides the dual benefits of keeping families together and saving the state money as compared to the cost of foster care.</p>
<p>Under this new federal CAPTA provision, should it pass, other states will need to follow Utah’s example if they want to keep receiving federal funds.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #990033;">
<strong>ParentalRights.org is proud to be a part of H.R. 6233, and encourages lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to join us in supporting it.</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>While only the <a style="color: #990033;" href="https://parentalrights.org/amendment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Parental Rights Amendment </a>can ultimately secure our fundamental rights in the courts and across the full panorama of our daily life experiences, that is a tremendous undertaking that will yet take time to accomplish. In the meantime, measures like H.R. 6233 can offer immediate hope in specific areas of parental rights law.</p>
<p>In short, H.R. 6233 can protect children by empowering parents to keep their families together.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #990033;">
<strong>Thank you for <u>
<a style="color: #990033;" href="https://secure.parentalrights.org/np/clients/parentalrights/donation.jsp?campaign=5&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">investing your time and money with us</a>
</u> to secure these protections in our law.</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>May you and your family enjoy a fun and festive Fourth of July!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<strong>Thank you, thank you, thank you!</strong>

<p>
</p>
<p>Yesterday’s lobby day almost couldn’t have gone any better. The offices we visited were welcoming and the staffers we talked to were receptive to our cause of parental rights.</p>
<p>That is the result of your calls and emails in support of both the Amendment and our visits. They knew we weren’t just there for ourselves, but for you as well.</p>
<p>We even learned of an office willing to meet with us at the last minute thanks to the efforts of our volunteers. We got that message too late to see them yesterday (their available time slot had already passed), but we are in contact with that office now to follow up.</p>
<p>In all, the meetings we had were promising and encouraging, and we hope to see additional cosponsors sign on soon.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #1c8296;">
<strong>Keep Calling Through Tomorrow</strong>
</span>
<br>
That said, though, it is still not too late to call in and urge your congressman’s support. Congress will be in recess next week, but <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>until then—through Friday of this week—we encourage you to <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="http://parentalrights.org/news/current/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">keep calling.</a>

<![CDATA[<p>It’s time!</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>Today is the day to call your congressman and senators </strong>
</span>and urge them to support the Parental Rights Amendment!</p>

</p>
<p>Many of you signed up for these emails specifically so you would know when to call Congress and make your voice heard. The time is now—today through Wednesday, June 27!</p>
<p>That’s because our team will be going to D.C. on Wednesday, talking with members of Congress about the proposed Parental Rights Amendment. <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>Your calls before then will make the difference</strong>
</span> between an office greeting us with, “You’re here about what, again?” and an office greeting us with, “Ah! We’ve been hearing about this. Tell us what it’s all about!”</p>
<p>Together—with your calls empowering our visits—we can open the eyes of more congressmen and senators to support this important effort to keep children safely where they belong: with the parents who love them.</p>
<hr style="height: 1px; border: none; color: #1c8296; background-color: #1c8296;">
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center">
<span style="color: #1c8296;">
<b>What Do I Say?</b>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">1. You can find your lawmakers’ contact information </span>
<a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/map">
<span style="color: #cc7700;">here</span>
</a>
</strong>, or just call the Capitol Switchboard at 202.224.3121 and ask for your lawmaker by name. (You can also ask for your senators by state, even if you don’t remember their name.) They will connect you with your lawmaker’s office, where you will probably speak to a member of their staff.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>2. Tell your congressman’s office something like this:</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">I’m calling to urge Congressman ____ to sign on as a cosponsor of H.J.Res. 121, the proposed Parental Rights Amendment, led by Rep. Hultgren of Illinois. Last week everyone was talking about the 2,000 children taken from their parents at the border since April. That’s how many children are taken by Child Protective Services in our country <i>every three days</i>. Something must be done to keep innocent families together without hurting the state’s ability to protect children from abuse. This Amendment strikes that balance and deserves your support.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>3. Tell your senator’s office something very similar:</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">I’m calling to urge Senator ____ to sign on as a cosponsor of S.J.Res. 48, the proposed Parental Rights Amendment, led by Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. Last week everyone was talking about the 2,000 children taken from their parents at the border since April. That’s how many children are taken by Child Protective Services in our country <i>every three days</i>. Something must be done to keep innocent families together without hurting the state’s ability to protect children from abuse. This Amendment strikes that balance and deserves your support.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>When the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) held a <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>conference on “the opioid crisis and foster care families”</strong>
</span> on June 7 in Washington, D.C., ParentalRights.org’s Maggie McKneely was there to observe the discussion and make new contacts with fresh allies for parental rights.</p>
<p>In the morning, keynote speaker Gov. Doug Ducey (R-AZ) discussed the policy changes his state has implemented to reduce the number of children in foster care, even as opioid drug addiction has ravaged the country. He talked about a fresh focus on family support and preservation.</p>
<p>Then in the afternoon AEI held a panel discussion featuring Elizabeth Bartholet of Harvard Law School, Robin Ghertner of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Brandon Logan of the Texas Public Policy Foundation, and AEI’s own Resident Scholar Sally Satel.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>The panel featured diverse views: </strong>
</span>Bartholet endorsed the idea of universal mandatory home visitation, while other panelists were more in favor of preserving family integrity and privacy. In the words of one of our coalition partners, “Bartholet…wound up standing alone,” which in this case is good news for parental rights.</p>
<p>The event did not involve lawmakers or legislation; nothing coming out of the day’s events will directly affect the laws where you or I live. But <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>policy discussions like this tend to identify allies, strengthen and grow coalitions, and promote the ideals that will become tomorrow’s laws.</strong>
</span> For this reason, we are grateful Maggie was able to attend, and to make some good connections along the way.</p>

</big>
</span>
</p>
<p>Exciting news! Next week, Maggie and the rest of <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>the ParentalRights.org team will be back in D.C.</strong>
</span>, not for a conference, but to meet with members of Congress whom we hope will cosponsor the Parental Rights Amendment! So watch your emails, as <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<b>we will be hosting a call blitz to Congress next Tuesday and Wednesday</b>
</span> to urge support for this vital effort and will need <i>you</i> to call your representative and senators.</p>
<p>Every day more families are torn apart by over-reaching bureaucrats because the parents’ rights are not appropriately respected in our nation’s courts. Only the proposed Parental Rights Amendment can restore the longstanding traditional legal respect for your family. <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>So I hope we can count on you to partner with us in that call blitz next week.</strong>

<p>Thank you as always for standing with us to protect children by empowering their parents through the Parental Rights Amendment.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>They’re at it again.</p>
<p>Once more, <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>academic legal scholars are trying to hypothesize away your parental rights,</strong>
</span> as well as your child’s right to be represented and protected under your care.</p>
<p>The latest salvo comes from law professors Anne C. Dailey of the University of Connecticut School of Law and Laura A. Rosenbury of the University of Florida Levin College of Law, and was published in the <em>Yale Law Journal</em> this April.</p>
<p>In <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/article/the-new-law-of-the-child" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“The New Law of the Child,”</a> <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>Dailey and Rosenbury seek to “loose[n] the grip of parental rights on American law.”</strong>
</span> They seek “a more child-centered analysis that elevates children’s broader interests over parents’ individual liberty claims.”</p>
<p>In a shocking echo of <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://parentalrights.org/dwyer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Professor James Dwyer</a>, who claimed last fall that “the reason that the parent-child relationship exists is because the state confers legal parenthood,” the pair declare <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>“both the recognition of the parent-child relationship and the grant of parental rights are state decisions.”</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>Even after much hand-wringing, Dailey and Rosenbury cannot escape the basic balance of legal authority between parents and the state. Their so-called “new law of the child” ultimately amounts to little more than a shifting of existing powers, taking from parents discipline decisions, religious exemption laws, and the right to home school. They also suggest that states might mandate annual oversight by a physician and must provide “access to reproductive health care free from parental vetoes,” including an obligation to “cover their costs.”</p>
<p>Ultimately, “under [their] framework, courts would determine the scope of children’s agency rights,” turning the decision making power of loving parents over to unfamiliar judges.</p>
<p>In a response titled <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/forum/the-not-so-new-law-of-the-child" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“The (Not So) New Law of the Child,”</a> New York University law professor Martin Guggenheim in the same journal takes Dailey and Rosenbury to task. (We count it an honor that Dr. Guggenheim is allied with us in the coalition to reform the Adoption and Safe Families Act and the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act to better protect children by preserving parental rights.)</p>
<p>Guggenheim notes that “their fix for current failings in the law is to shift ultimate decision-making authority from parents to judges.”</p>
<p>He also mentions that, contrary to Dailey and Rosenbury’s apparent assumptions, <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>“I have never met a parent who constructs his or her child predominantly as an object of control.”</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>In other words, we don’t exercise parental rights because we “get to,” but because it is our sacred duty to the children we love. And on this we wholly agree.</p>
<p>While Guggenheim’s refutation of “The New Law of the Child” is powerful, it cannot completely undo the damage of Dailey and Rosenbury’s article being published in the first place. <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>Ideas have consequences, </strong>
</span>and these professors have once again echoed the idea that the state can somehow better provide for and direct children than loving parents can.</p>
<p>There is little doubt that over time this chorus of statist legal scholars will only get louder. <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>Which is why it is so important to make our own voices heard in defense of parental rights.</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>Could you take a moment today to<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong> <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://secure.parentalrights.org/np/clients/parentalrights/donation.jsp?campaign=5&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">

The inescapable parental rights story in the news right now is that of <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-merseyside-43883865#" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alfie Evans</a>, the British boy who died this weekend after a long legal and medical battle. The court granted Alder Hey Hospital’s bid to remove the toddler from life support against his parents’ wishes, and denied the parents their right to take their child to Italy—at no further expense to the United Kingdom or Alder Hey—for treatment at a hospital there. Alfie suffered for days after being deprived of proper treatment or even food as those we trust to “first do no harm” simply watched him die.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>Alfie’s experience is a tragic picture of what happens when government has the power to decide what is best for your children. </strong>
</span>Our own Supreme Court has in the past held that parents are the proper gatekeepers for their children’s rights and well-being, but the tide of “government knows best” sentiment is rising. This is why we fight to protect parental rights in the U.S. Constitution and in state law.</p>

<br>
Part of that effort this month involved the “Parents Know Best” rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, on April 10. <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>Our own Maggie McKneely was on hand to encourage state lawmakers to support H.B. 1349</strong>
</span>, a bill introduced by Rep. Tallman that will define parental rights as fundamental and secure to them the highest standard of review.</p>
<p>Maggie joined American Family Association of Pennsylvania President Diane Gramley and our own Pennsylvania State Coordinator (and new board member) Vickie Suarez in encouraging families gathered in the state capitol’s rotunda to lobby their lawmakers. Several state representatives, including Rep. Tallman, addressed the assembly of parental rights supporters as well.</p>
<p>Though the bill remains in committee, we are excited by the increased attention we are drawing to parental rights in the Keystone State.</p>

<p>In Nebraska, meanwhile, ParentalRights.org volunteers Ed Hernandez and State Coordinator Leroy Becker drew attention at a critical moment. <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://nebraskalegislature.gov/bills/view_bill.php?DocumentID=34288" target="_blank" rel="noopener">L.B. 998</a>, a bill that would possibly have allowed schools to submit children to mental health screenings without first notifying parents, passed the legislature on April 18 and was on its way to adoption before the alarm was sounded. <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>Thanks in part to the timely intervention of our state volunteer leaders, however, the governor vetoed the bill last Tuesday. </strong>
</span>Among <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://governor.nebraska.gov/sites/governor.nebraska.gov/files/doc/press/LB%20998%20Veto%20%282018%29.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other concerns</a>, Governor Ricketts stated that “[t]he bill is also unclear about how parents and guardians would be involved in the consent and care of the student for screening, referral, treatment and payment for services” and that “[t]he bill does not provide a clear and respectful role for the parents and guardians of a minor child.”</p>

<p>We’ve serendipitously stepped into an effort drawing attention to parental rights in Minnesota, as well. <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://www.care2.com/causes/racism-in-child-protective-services-is-tearing-minnesota-families-apart.html">Lawmakers there introduced the “Minnesota African American Family Preservation Act” (S.F. 3779)</a> to change the state’s policies involving the separation of innocent minority families. We can claim no credit for that. As it happens, though, <span style="color: #cc7700;">

</span>

<p>That report, which has a separate pull-out page for each state, shows at a glance which racial groups are disproportionately represented in child welfare cases based on numbers of “substantiated” maltreatment as reported by each state for 2016.</p>

<strong>

</span>And in the midst of all that, we also managed to give our website at <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://parentalrightsfoundation.org">parentalrightsfoundation.org</a> a major facelift. (If you haven’t visited lately, go check it out!)</p>
<p>For all of this I need to say, “Thank you.” <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>We couldn’t have done any of this without your support</strong>
</span>, and I’m not just talking about your <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://secure.parentalrights.org/np/clients/parentalrights/donation.jsp?campaign=5&amp;">donations</a> (though we are entirely funded by donors just like you). Without your encouragement, your website visits, your Facebook likes, your email opens, your volunteer hours, your lobbying, and your phone calls, we could not hope to make any difference in the world.</p>
<p>But with your continued support in all these ways, we can truly hope to see parental rights protected to safeguard all our children.</p>
<p>Gratefully,</p>

Rep. Tallman, who has faithfully introduced a similar measure in each of the last 4 sessions, cannot <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billinfo/billinfo.cfm?sYear=2017&amp;sInd=0&amp;body=H&amp;type=B&amp;bn=1349" target="_blank" rel="noopener">move the bill</a> out of committee on his own; <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>we need your help to change the atmosphere in Harrisburg and give parental rights a push forward.</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>Fortunately, Pennsylvania is one of several states whose courts have chosen to ignore the precedent for weak parental rights implied in the U.S. Supreme Court’s <em>Troxel v. Granville</em> (2000) decision. That’s the decision that says parental rights are fundamental, but they are only worthy of “some special weight.” Instead, Pennsylvania’s Supreme Court has stuck to its own precedent: since parental rights are fundamental, laws restricting them “must satisfy the constitutional standard know as strict scrutiny.” <em>Schmehl v. Wegelin</em> (Pa. 2007)</p>
<p>That’s a great standard for the courts to set—but it can be changed at any time by the whim of that same court. Until the legislature defines your rights by legislative mandate, that court precedent is subject to change.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>HB1349 would take Pennsylvania’s existing court case precedent and make it a matter of statutory law. </strong>
</span>Other states, such as Virginia in 2013, are already taking this important precaution.</p>
<p>Sadly, though, this common sense measure only has 10 cosponsors so far, and it has again gotten bogged down in committee.</p>
<hr style="height: 1px; border: none; color: #1c8296; background-color: #1c8296;">
<p style="color: #5e5d5d;">
<span style="color: #1c8296;">
<strong>Action Items</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>1. Call your state representative and urge them to cosponsor HB1349.</strong>
</span> Bills with more cosponsors get taken more seriously and have an easier time getting heard in committee. (For comparison, a bill recently voted out of the Children and Youth Committee had 32 cosponsors.) You can find your <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/home/findyourlegislator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">representative’s contact information here</a>.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>2.</strong> <strong>Contact the members of the Children and Youth Committee</strong> </span>and ask them to hear and vote for HB1349. You can find the whole committee and their contact information on the <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/cteeInfo/Index.cfm?CteeBody=H&amp;Code=48" target="_blank" rel="noopener">committee’s page</a>, and you can call Chairman Katharine Watson at 717.787.5452.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">3. Spread the word</span>.</strong> Send this email to your friends and neighbors and ask them to join the push to get HB1349 out of committee and into the full House for a vote.</p>
<p>
<em>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>Sample Message to Use When Calling or Emailing: </strong>
</span>In your own words, let your lawmakers know you believe parents are in a position to make better decisions for their children than government can. HB1349 would protect this basic principle, while still protecting children from abuse. Parental rights are fundamental; our courts already know this. HB1349 would ensure that this rule continues to protect parental rights into the future. In a day when dentists right here in Pennsylvania are threatening parents with neglect for missing a cleaning, this kind of basic legal protection for our families just makes sense.</em>

<![CDATA[<p>A new Michigan law will make it harder for child welfare investigators and family courts to remove children from fit and loving parents.</p>
<p>Last week I enjoyed getting to share with you the good news of Utah’s new law clarifying the legal definition of “neglect.” With as many as 80% of child welfare investigations across the country citing this nebulous charge, we find that providing some limits and definition to just what the term means can be a huge help in reducing inappropriate, unnecessary intrusion into innocent families.</p>
<p>That’s why this week I’m excited to tell you about Michigan’s new law.</p>
<p>
<a style="color: #cc7700;" href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(gybvz3jcsbztendu25kjmpee))/mileg.aspx?page=BillStatus&amp;objectname=2017-SB-0420" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SB 420</a>, introduced by Sen. Phillip Pavlov in May of 2017, passed the legislature on February 21 of this year and was signed by Governor Rick Snyder on March 15. Two provisions in the new law will help parents who come into contact with “the system.”</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #1c8296;">
<em>
<strong>Clarifying “Neglect”</strong>
</em>
</span>
<br>
One of the provisions is, like Utah’s law, <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>a clarification of the term, “neglect.”</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>Until this bill was passed, Michigan law defined “child neglect” like this:</p>
<p style="margin-left: .5in;">“harm or threatened harm to a child’s welfare by a parent, legal guardian, or any other person responsible for the child’s health or welfare that occurs through…[n]egligent treatment, including the failure to provide adequate food, clothing, shelter, or medical care….”</p>
<p>Now, this last section has been edited to read:</p>
<p style="margin-left: .5in;">“Negligent treatment, including the failure to provide adequate food, clothing, shelter, or medical care, though financially able to do so, or by the failure to seek financial or other reasonable means to provide adequate food, clothing, shelter, or medical care.”</p>
<p>What’s the big difference? <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<b>Until this bill was passed, parents were at risk of losing their children due to “neglect” simply for the “crime” of being poor.</b> </span>The addition of “though financially able to do so” provides a carve-out for those parents who fail to provide for their child simply because they lack the means to do so.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong. It is the sacred duty of a parent to meet the real physical and emotional needs of their child. But when they are financially unable to provide enough, <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<b>this new law directs the state to help the family, not to break the family apart.</b>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #1c8296;">
<em>
<strong>Preventing Automatic Termination of Other Children</strong>
</em>
</span>
<br>
A second key provision of the law would end the long-held practice of automatically terminating the rights of a parent who has already lost parental rights to a previous child.</p>
<p>If, for instance, a mom a few years ago lost her rights to her now-ten-year-old son due to abuse or neglect, then when it is discovered she is pregnant again, the state would move into position to take this new baby from her care as soon as she is born. There would be no need for an investigation or a trial. She abused or neglected the 10-year-old; it was safe to assume she would harm this new baby in the same way.</p>
<p>The new law has changed all of that. The section of law that orders the department of child services to file for termination of parental rights if “the parent’s rights to another child were terminated” previously now has an added proviso: “…and the parent has failed to rectify the conditions that led to the prior termination of parental rights.”</p>
<p>This means <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<b>the state must now show not only a prior termination of parental rights order, but also that the parent has not taken effective steps to fix the problem(s) in their parenting. </b>
</span>This requires a hearing and a positive showing by the state. That is a long way from the automatic removal to which so many parents have until now had to resign themselves.</p>
<p>After all, that mother may have learned and grown a lot since she lost her son all those years ago. This “second chance” provides her the incentive to make the sacrifices that are necessary to be a good parent to her new baby girl.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<span style="color: #1c8296;">
<b>Help Us Keep Moving Forward!</b>
</span>
</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We can’t take the credit for these latest bills, but neither do we think it a coincidence that 10 years into our mission of promoting parental rights, laws like these are suddenly being passed. Nor do we think it an accident that, after we invested so much of the last few years in Detroit, Michigan is one of the states showing the greatest gains.</p>
<p>Obviously we are not alone in this fight; other parental rights and family rights groups, like the ones we’re partnering with to amend the Adoption and Safe Families Act, deserve a lot of credit, too. But we are proud to be shaping the culture of America to respect the rights of parents just a little bit more each day.</p>
<p>While other forces are working so hard to rob you of your rights, we are working to open the discussion—to make your friends, neighbors, and lawmakers aware of what is going on. And we are working to pass laws like these to make real changes in Congress and the states.</p>

<strong>PA Dentist Threatens Parents</strong>
</span>
</span>
</p>
<p>A dentist’s office in Pennsylvania has made headlines and sparked a social media firestorm of angry parents. Dr. Ross Wezmar of Smiles 4 Keeps came under fire for a letter citing Pennsylvania Act 31 and <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>threatening to report parents for neglect if they failed to schedule their child’s next cleaning with the practice.</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>The letter, as posted at <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://healthimpactnews.com/2018/mom-stands-up-to-dental-bullying-when-dentist-threatens-to-call-cps-over-missed-dental-appointment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Health Impact News</a>, reads in part, “Pennsylvania Act 31 (Child Abuse Reporting and Recognition Requirements) states that health care providers must report your failure to bring your child to the dentist for evaluation and care.” That’s not a provision we could find in the Act, however. (Read the Act for yourself <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/Legis/LI/uconsCheck.cfm?txtType=HTM&amp;yr=2014&amp;sessInd=0&amp;smthLwInd=0&amp;act=31" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.)</p>
<p>Mom Trey Hoyumpa, rather than being intimidated by the threat, took the issue to social media. From there it went viral, attracting the attention of Health Impact News and of conservative journalist Michelle Malkin, who featured the matter on multiple sites including Heritage Foundation’s <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://www.dailysignal.com/2018/03/30/dental-office-threatens-parents-kids-dental-neglect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
<i>The Daily Signal</i>
</a> and <i>The Jewish World Review</i>.</p>
<p>ParentalRights.org has shared before that to get good results in court, we need two complementary things: good laws and good judges. If we get bad results, the problem could be one or the other, or sometimes both.</p>
<p>In this case, the Act identifies “mandatory reporters”—those required by law to make a report if they have reason to suspect child abuse or neglect—and lists training requirements they must meet to be licensed in the state. <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>But nowhere does it mention missing a dental cleaning as a cause to report a parent for neglect. </strong>
</span>(In fact, no definitions for “abuse” or “neglect” are included in Act 31.)</p>
<p>In this instance, the law seems fine; the problem is with its application by the dentist.</p>
<p>According to Malkin, Wezmar claims Smiles 4 Keeps sent the letter “to jar the parent to realize that with a child comes responsibility.” And if that “jarring” results in more money to the dentist’s office as intimidated parents bring their child in for fear of Child Protective Services, well, so much the better.</p>
<p>As pointed out by Health Impact News, Dr. Wezmar’s associations listed on the practice’s website include work with “Harvard University Children’s Hospital,” better known as Boston Children’s Hospital (the site of Justina Pelletier’s now infamous ordeal).</p>
<p>It’s no wonder Hoyumpa accused the dentist’s office of “bullying” and “intimidation.”</p>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center">
<span style="font-size: 20px;">
<span style="color: #1c8296;">
<b>Utah Adopts a Better Way</b>
</span>
</span>
</p>
<p>That is exactly the kind of abuse of the system which a newly passed Utah bill seeks to address.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>SB 65 made a substantive amendment to the legal definition of “neglect.” </strong>
</span>According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, as many as 80% of child welfare investigations arise from this nebulous charge. It’s the allegation raised by Smiles 4 Keeps, and too often it is defined in the field as “daring to parent in a way the doctor/dentist/investigator doesn’t like.”</p>
<p>But that is no longer to be the case in Utah.</p>
<p>
<a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://le.utah.gov/~2018/bills/sbillenr/SB0065.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Under SB 65</a>, “neglect” explicitly “does not include…permitting a child…to engage in independent activities, including: traveling to and from school, including by walking, running, or bicycling…; engaging in outdoor play; remaining in a vehicle unattended [with exceptions]; remaining home unattended; or engaging in a similar independent activity” (section numbers and formatting omitted). So Utah parents who want to raise independent, responsible adults will no longer be hamstrung by a system that sees every risk as a call for a neglect proceeding.</p>
<p>The bill also excludes “a health care decision made for a child by the child’s parent or guardian, unless the state or other party to a proceeding shows, by clear and convincing evidence, that the health care decision is not reasonable and informed.” <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>Under such a provision, Smiles 4 Keeps would be hard-pressed to threaten any good parent who chooses not to get their child’s teeth cleaned on time.</strong>
</span> <a href="https://holistickenko.com/oil-pulling-holistic-oral-care/">Oil pulling</a> is an effective way to clean your teeth. Such a choice simply does not meet the legal definition of neglect.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center">
<span style="font-size: 20px;">
<span style="color: #1c8296;">
<b>What We Can Do</b>
</span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>The Smiles 4 Keeps letter clearly demonstrates why changes like the Utah law are needed in all 50 states. </strong>
</span>We can make those changes either by passing state legislation like SB 65, or by amending federal laws like the Adoption and Safe Families Act (ASFA) and the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA) to close the loopholes so ripe for abuse. Ultimately, the <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://parentalrights.org/amendment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Parental Rights Amendment to the U.S. Constitution</a> will help raise the bar for parental rights nationwide.</p>
<p>And we are proud to be actively pursuing all of these solutions. In state legislatures, through a bipartisan coalition for ASFA and CAPTA reform, and with the Parental Rights Amendment in Congress, we are on the front lines to protect parents like Trey Hoyumpa from those who would define “neglect” to fit any parent they just don’t like.</p>
<p>But to continue our successes, we need our voice to grow.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #1c8296;">

<![CDATA[<p>A 38-year-old father and his attorney have managed to uncover an illegal practice so widespread that its exposure could overturn dozens, or even hundreds, of child welfare proceedings in one North Carolina county.</p>
<p>According to an investigation and <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/ap-exclusive-nc-county-illegally-removed-kids-from-homes/ar-BBKdmY1?ocid=spartanntp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">March 15 report by the Associated Press</a>, the Cherokee County Department of Social Services has <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>been using Custody and Visitation Agreements (CVA’s) to take children away from their parents without ever going before a judge.</strong>
</span> And if they hadn’t taken the daughter of Brian Hogan, they might still be using it today.</p>
<p>Hogan, an out-of-work pipe-fitter in the impoverished rural county, got a call in 2016 that his wife had suffered a major heart attack. So he left his 10-year-old daughter with a neighbor (and the girl’s best friend) and drove the 60 miles to the ICU in Asheville. He was still spending his time at his wife’s side a few days later when he learned his daughter had been taken into custody because a school teacher had reported that she “smelled like cat,” and a subsequent investigation determined she was living in unclean conditions. (The report does not mention whether the neighbor’s daughter was also taken.)</p>
<p>That’s when Hogan was forced to sign the illegal CVA.</p>
<p>“I had no choice,” Hogan told the AP, which reported that the county “threatened to throw him in jail, place his child in foster care or give his daughter to another family for adoption if he didn’t sign.” So, sign he did. But he also sought the help of an attorney to get his daughter back.</p>
<p>Enter Melissa Jackson. She agreed to help Hogan, and soon discovered the bizarre and unacceptable practice. Using CVAs to remove children from their parents is illegal, “because they did not take place with court oversight, as required by law,” according to the AP.</p>
<p>Here’s the way it worked: a DSS worker would come to the home, and if they decided the child should be removed, they would identify a family relative and draft up the CVA. The parent would be told to sign the CVA, transferring custody to the relative, or DSS would place the child with strangers in foster care. Neither the parents nor, often, the relatives receiving the child would know their rights or the illegality of the transaction. But for DSS, it meant the child never entered the system at all, and often there would be no follow-up or oversight.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>Once the illegal practice was exposed in court,</strong>
</span> <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>an investigation determined it had been used in an undetermined number of cases, perhaps affecting hundreds of children. </strong>
</span>Scott Lindsay, a longtime attorney recently fired from the county’s DSS, says he started using CVAs in 2007 or even before. And since they are not properly documented in DSS records, DSS cannot say how many were affected or even where all of those children are now.</p>
<p>When the practice was exposed, the state’s Department of Health and Human Services reacted immediately, issuing a letter in December to county DSS departments to advise them that the use of such CVAs “falls outside of both law and policy,” according to the AP report.</p>
<p>Then this month, when the AP story was released, the state’s HHS took the rare step of completely taking over the county’s DSS operation, according to another <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/state-child-welfare-office-ap-story-53807693" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AP report of March 16</a>.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #1c8296;">
<b>Secretive System Ripe for Abuse</b>
</span>
<br>
What happened in Cherokee County—forcing parents to sign a CVA transferring custody of their child to a relative—<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>is illegal and an abuse of the system. </strong>
</span>It is not the norm and does not take place everywhere (though National Coalition for Child Protection Reform’s Richard Wexler recently pointed out <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="http://bit.ly/blog32018" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on their blog</a> that the general practice of coercion, with CVA or no, is indeed widespread).</p>
<p>But a system designed as ours is to operate outside the public view is bound to give rise to these violations. It is no wonder we are regaled by story after story of abuse within a system that operates in secret, acts with impunity, and defies public accountability.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #1c8296;">
<b>Taking Action</b>
</span>
<br>
Amending federal and state laws to provide oversight for child protective agencies and juvenile courts is a great place to start. And a federal amendment to the Constitution protecting the right of parents can help, as well; by creating a clear standard, it would make these violations more immediately recognizable for the offenses that they are.</p>
<p>That’s why ParentalRights.org supports the proposed Parental Rights Amendment, champions revisions to federal laws like the Adoption and Safe Families Act (ASFA) and the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA), and works for changes to state laws as well. There is so much work to be done, but the cost of failure is far too high.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>Together we can make a change and draw attention to the plight of families and children in the system. </strong>
</span>Then maybe next time an overzealous state agent looks to sidestep a parent’s due process rights and fundamental liberty to the care and custody of their child, someone will challenge the practice immediately and not ten years down the road.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<![CDATA[<p>The Office of Civil Rights (OCR) in the federal Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) recently released a wide-ranging <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/01/26/2018-01226/protecting-statutory-conscience-rights-in-health-care-delegations-of-authority" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proposed rule</a> that focused on increasing protections for the rights of conscience and religious liberties in the area of health care services. Several provisions of the rule pertain to the issue of parental rights. <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>Interested people can provide comments, which are due by Tuesday, March 27.</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>The proposed rule, <i>Protecting Statutory Conscience Rights in Health </i>Care; <i>Delegations of Authority</i>, (83 FR 3880) states that:</p>
<p style="margin-left: .5in;">HHS proposes this rule to enhance the awareness and enforcement of federal health care conscience and associated anti-discrimination laws, to further conscience and religious freedom, and to protect the rights of individuals and entities to abstain from certain activities related to health care services without discrimination or retaliation.</p>
<p>In addition to<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong> laying down some new regulations</strong>
</span>, it also <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>revises old regulations</strong>
</span> to make certain that the correct practices and policies are in place that will help promote the rights of individuals and entities in the area of individual health care decisions. Toward this end, the proposed rule states the following:</p>
<p style="margin-left: .5in;">Through this rulemaking, the Department proposes to grant overall responsibility to its Office of Civil Rights (OCR) for ensuring that the Department, its components, HHS programs and activities, and those who participate in HHS programs or activities comply with federal laws protecting the rights of conscience and prohibiting associated discriminatory policies and practices in such programs and activities.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>One provision affecting parental rights addresses the issue of vaccinations. </strong>
</span>While ParentalRights.org does not take any official position on the use of vaccinations, the provision in this proposed rule does guarantee greater protection for parents to make their own informed medical decisions for their children. Section XII C (1) (i) specifically makes reference to ensuring that persons and entities are not “being required to administer or receive certain vaccinations derived from aborted fetal tissues as a condition of work or receipt of educational services.” This rule also includes broader “provisions [to] protect parents who conscientiously object to their children being forced to receive certain treatments or health interventions.” (Section III (I))</p>
<p>ParentalRights.org is excited to see the steps that HHS is taking to ensure that parents have the right to make their own choices regarding the health care of their children.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>If you would like to comment and voice your opinions regarding the proposed rule,</strong>

<p>Representative Kevin Calvey’s <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://legiscan.com/OK/bill/HB3686/2018" target="_blank" rel="noopener">House Bill (HB) 3686</a> will be heard this week!</p>

<span style="color: #1c8296;">
<strong>About HB 3686</strong>
</span>
<br>
HB 3686 will change how anonymous calls to the child abuse prevention hotline are handled in Oklahoma.</p>
<p>First, confidential calls will still be taken by CPS and the name of the caller will always be protected. A reporter’s identity will not be disclosed except with the very rare instance of a court order.</p>
<p>Fully anonymous calls, however, will be transferred to 911, allowing CPS to focus on reports with complete details of child abuse and neglect.</p>
<p>HB 3686 seeks to offer further protection to stable and loving parents from undue investigation and stress, as anonymous reports are often made with selfish or malicious intent. In some cases an ex-spouse or angry friend may call in a report out of spite or revenge.</p>
<p>HB 3686 seeks to remove these careless calls from the statewide hotline, where they burden Oklahoma’s DHS workers who already have hefty case loads.</p>
<p>Representative Calvey’s bill is designed to help DHS workers and protect Oklahoma parents.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Dear Champion of Parental Rights,</p>
<p>One hundred and forty-eight days. Imagine if that’s how long the government kept your child from you, without any evidence or justification.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>It sounds like a nightmare, but it was a reality for Georgia mom Amy Spencer.</strong>
</span> And she is not alone.</p>
<p>Too many American families are facing similarly devastating situations. My office hears from parents all the time who have had their children ripped away and their rights trampled on and ignored. That’s what happens when the state workers think they can do a better job of raising your kids than you can.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>
<img src="https://secure.parentalrights.org/neon/resource/parentalrights/images/SmallerImages/bear.png">
</strong>
</span>But this is why <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
<a style="color: #cc7700; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://secure.parentalrights.org/np/clients/parentalrights/donation.jsp?campaign=5&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
<span style="color: #cc7700; text-decoration: underline;">
<strong>your continued partnership with us</strong>
</span>
</a>
</span> is so critically important. Because of you, ParentalRights.org is able to provide a light in the darkness for parents like these. Through legislation such as the Parental Rights Amendment and state statutes that protect your rights, we are working to stop the erosion of your role as a parent.</p>
<p>Because the fact is, if no one fights back against the injustices we hear about every day, the government will continue to encroach on your rights.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<b>But with your help, we <i>are</i> fighting back. </b>
</span>
</p>
<p>Through the Parental Rights Foundation, we recently filed suit on behalf of several Georgia families (including Amy Spencer) who suffered inexcusable abuse at the hands of government officials, officials who claimed to act in the best interest of the children involved. The defendants in that case have filed a motion to have the court dismiss it; we are waiting on the judge to make a decision, praying we will get to go to trial.</p>
<p>That lawsuit is about justice for these families, but <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>their case also highlights why ParentalRights.org <i>must keep working</i> to pass the Parental Rights Amendment.</strong>
</span>

</strong>
</span>
<span style="color: #1c8296;">
<strong>“The Georgia Nine” Case</strong>
</span>
<br>
You may remember when we told you about Tobias, the dad who called us after his kids and those of several of his fellow church members were unjustly taken by the government. The “Georgia Nine” case is a story filled with corruption, invasive investigations, and abuse. <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>Nine parents and their 14 children will never be the same </strong>
</span>because of what was done to them.</p>
<p>[Picture credit: istockphoto]</p>
<p>While these families made an emergency stop in Mississippi on their way home from a church conference, several of the kids took advantage of the down-time to raise money for their church dance team. That’s when over-zealous social worker Philana Harrell accused the families of “child trafficking.”</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<b>One false allegation</b>. </span>That’s all it took for the government to change these families’ lives forever.</p>
<p>Harrell insisted that the parents must provide proof that these children were actually theirs before they could have them back. First, this meant that they needed to show photo ID’s and birth certificates. But by the time one couple had driven all the way home to Atlanta to retrieve these and made it back to the police station in Mississippi, Harrell had decided that was no longer good enough.</p>
<p>Most of us would not think twice about traveling with our children from one state to another with no more identification than our driver’s license. <i>But can you imagine being told that finger printing and a background check were required to prove that your children actually are your children?</i> That’s exactly what Harrell had the audacity to demand of these families under color of law.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Harrell and her colleagues caused direct trauma to the children by separating them from their own moms and dads and putting them into foster families, some of which proved to be abusive. <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>Is that the mark of a government that acts in the best interests of children?</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>Months of invasive and traumatizing investigations followed. These families did everything that was asked of them — over and over again! — yet the Department of Human Services employees kept changing the requirements and continued to refuse to return the children!</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>It wasn’t until almost <i>5 months</i> after that church trip that all of the children were finally back home with their parents.</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>At no point were the parents charged with any crime. There were no allegations of abuse or neglect (except that original, baseless accusation of “child trafficking”). In fact, there was no evidence of any wrongdoing whatsoever. Just one child services investigator who, armed with the power of the government, decided she knew what was best for these children.</p>
<p>“It makes our children [feel] as if we couldn’t protect them,” one of the parents stated in an interview with ParentalRights.org. “Our children should always see us as Superman or Superwoman, and they took that from us that day.”</p>

<strong>
<img src="https://secure.parentalrights.org/neon/resource/parentalrights/images/SmallerImages/capitol.png">Fighting to Fix the Unjust System</strong>
</span>
<br>
Although I can’t turn back the clock and save these families from the ordeal that they went through, we can fight to make sure this doesn’t happen to any other families.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<b>Because you and I both know that this tremendous abuse of parental rights is utterly unacceptable. </b>
</span>
</p>
<p>It’s heartbreaking to know that every day there are American families who have to fight for the right to raise their children. The “Georgia Nine” case is just one of many where the government assumes that it can do a better job of raising children than their own parents can.</p>
<p>Sometimes it’s a medical disagreement like in the cases of Isaiah Rider or Justina Pelletier, whose parents disagreed with one hospital’s diagnosis of their child and suddenly found themselves on the outside looking in regarding medical care and even custody. Sometimes it’s an abuse of our already troubled system, as in the case of Tori Harper of Tennessee, who called in a concern for her child and suddenly found <i>herself </i>the prime target of the investigation. We continually see families paying the price for a system that doesn’t respect a parent’s vital role.</p>
<p>But we are fighting to fix this unjust system. With the Parental Rights Amendment, state agents and judges would be obligated to recognize your fundamental right to decide and to act on what you believe is in the best interests of your child. With your dedicated support, ParentalRights.org is making sure that the law is on your side.</p>
<p>Last year, the Parental Rights Amendment was introduced in both houses of Congress for the first time since 2014. Now, we’re past the halfway point for this session and pushing harder than ever to move the Amendment forward. The clock is ticking!</p>
<p>Already this year we’ve seen growing congressional support, our online presence has increased, and we are moving towards passing more state parental rights statutes and resolutions. We’re also fighting government overreach in a wide range of areas, in a variety of states. And we’re supporting an effort by our friends at National Federation of the Blind to preserve the rights of parents with disabilities in state laws across the country. All of this is only possible because of your continued willingness to stand with us.</p>

<![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;">
<span style="font-size: 20px;">
<span style="color: #1c8296; line-height: 1.25;">
<strong>Efforts Are Underway This Year to Significantly Improve the Legal Landscape for Parents with Disabilities.</strong>
</span>
</span>
</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<strong>
<span style="color: #1c8296;">Current Disability Discrimination in Parental Rights</span>
</strong>
<br>
For decades, <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>parents with disabilities have entered the courtroom with the deck stacked against them.</strong>
</span> The Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation reported in 2016 that “35 states include disability as grounds for termination of parental rights,” and “in <i>every state</i>, disability of the parent can be included in determining the best interest of the child” (emphasis added).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>Such laws are manifestly unfair on their face. </strong>
</span>Yet, they are constitutionally acceptable based on a shameful ruling by the Supreme Court in 1927. In its eugenics-era <i>Buck v. Bell </i>decision, the Court declared, “It would be better for all the world if…society can prevent those who are manifestly unfit from continuing their kind.” Sadly, this deplorable decision to rob persons with disabilities of the Fourteenth Amendment rights others enjoy “to marry, establish a home and bring up children….” (<i>Meyer v. Nebraska</i>, 262 U.S. 390 (1923)), has never been overturned.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<span style="color: #1c8296;">
<strong>Efforts to Remove the Disability Discrimination</strong>
</span>
<br>
It is partially in response to the current tragic state of affairs, first called to our attention by the National Federation of the Blind (NFB), that Section Four was added to our proposed Parental Rights Amendment in 2015. That section, which would correct the error of <em>Buck v. Bell </em>when the Amendment is adopted, provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: left;">
<em>“The parental rights guaranteed by this article shall not be denied or abridged on account of disability.”</em>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">Now our allies at NFB are working on another, more limited but immediate solution. <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>Their state-level chapters have introduced bills</strong>
</span> in a number of states to remove this unfair disadvantage (one state at a time).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">

</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<em> August 2017 photo of ParentalRights.org’s Will Estrada and President Jim Mason, along with Dylan Hedtler-Gaudette and John Par</em>é<em> of National Federation of the Blind </em>
</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In <em>
<span style="color: #1c8296;">
<strong>Oregon</strong>
</span>
</em>, for instance, <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://olis.leg.state.or.us/liz/2018R1/Measures/Overview/SB1526">SB 1526</a> would amend Oregon law regarding the termination of parental rights to include a provision that “[t]he court may not consider a parent’s disability, as that term is defined in the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, unless the parent’s conduct related to the disability is of such nature and duration as to render the parent incapable of providing proper care for the child or ward for extended periods of time.” (Internal citation omitted.) This measure, which passed the Oregon Senate on Feb. 9 and is in the House Human Services and Housing Committee, would remove the ability of a judge to use a parent’s disability alone as grounds to remove their child.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<span style="color: #1c8296;">
<em>
<strong>Virginia’s</strong>
</em>
</span> <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://legiscan.com/VA/text/HB491/id/1675799" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HB 491</a> would have provided that “[a] parent’s disability shall not serve as the sole basis for the denial or restriction of custody or visitation,” nor as grounds to deny a prospective parent’s right to adopt a child or serve as a foster parent. Sadly this bill was left in the Courts of Justice Committee, but the effort may be renewed next year.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">“[S]ome disabled parents in Virginia and across the U.S. are having their right to raise a family denied,” Delegate Dave LaRock, one of two lead sponsors on the bill, said in a statement for ParentalRights.org. “This [bill] will be a high priority for me in the 2019 session.”</p>
<p>Delegate Todd Gilbert, the other sponsor, added, “This is too important to let it go uncorrected.”</p>

</span>, <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://legiscan.com/HI/text/SB2208/id/1703582" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SB 2208</a> and its companion bill, <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://legiscan.com/HI/text/HB1928/id/1703215" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HB 1928</a>, offer the same provision. And while we would like to see these measures apply equally to parents with whatever disability (and not just blindness), any step in the right direction is welcome.</p>

</span>, <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://nebraskalegislature.gov/FloorDocs/105/PDF/Intro/LB845.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LB 845</a> would put parents with disabilities on equal footing with all parents in questions of custody. The measure reads in part, “A parent’s disability shall not serve as a basis for denial or restriction of custody in family law matters when the custody is determined to be otherwise in the best interests of the child.” And while ParentalRights.org does not usually take sides in parent-versus-parent legislation or court battles, we favor this bill as another step in the right direction: toward the recognition of the parental rights of those parents with disabilities.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<span style="color: #1c8296;">
<strong>Action Items</strong>
</span>
</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: left;">
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>If you live in one of the states with an active bill </strong>
</span>(Oregon, Georgia, Hawaii, or Nebraska), <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://www.facebook.com/townhall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contact your state lawmakers</a> and ask them to support your state’s bill to protect the rights of parents with disabilities.</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">
<strong>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">If your state doesn’t have an active bill </span>
</strong>(and isn’t Virginia, where a bill was already introduced), <span style="color: #cc7700;">please let us know at</span> <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="mailto:info@parentalrights.org">info@parentalrights.org</a> if you become aware of any such bill in your state legislature.</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>Regardless of where you live, </strong>
</span>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">please share this email</span> with your friends and family so they, too, can contact their legislators, and so they can <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://parentalrights.org/get_involved/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sign up</a> to receive these parental rights notifications for themselves.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<strong>
<span style="color: #1c8296;">Thank you for helping us support bills protecting the rights of parents with disabilities.</span> </strong>Raising the bar for the parental rights of those with disabilities also raises the bar for parental rights in general. Why would a court take seriously a “fundamental right” that cannot even survive a parent’s disability? No, to truly protect these rights for <em>any</em> of us we must stand together and insist upon equal respect for all innocent parents, regardless of disability status.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Thank you for standing with us. Together, we can make a difference to protect our parental rights.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<em>“Innocent until proven guilty”</em> is a cherished principle of our justice system here in America.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>Unfortunately, it doesn’t always seem to apply to parents like you or me,</strong>
</span> as Tennessee mom Tori Harper recently learned the hard way.</p>

</a>
</strong>
</span>According to a <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="http://fox17.com/news/ferrier-files/ferrier-files-do-criminals-have-more-rights-than-parents-in-tennessee" target="_blank" rel="noopener">November article at WZTV in Nashville</a>, Tori shares custody of her two boys with her ex-husband. One day, the 3-year-old came home and told his mom something inappropriate had happened to him when he was with his father. Tori reported it to the Tennessee Department of Child Services (DCS) as required under state law.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>What happened next was a nightmare</strong>
</span> for this single mom and her two boys.</p>
<p>Interrogated for hours by DCS officials, with no video record and no attorney present, Tori soon realized it was she, and not her ex-husband, who was the focus of the investigation!</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>There was no allegation against Tori. </strong>
</span>The only report filed was the one she filed regarding an event at her ex-husband’s house. <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>Yet, DCS demanded she surrender her children on the spot</strong>
</span> (to her parents), for the duration of the investigation.</p>
<p>DCS in its effort to deprive Harper of her parental rights claimed she was mentally unstable and unfit to have custody of her boys.</p>
<p>The assault on the Harpers continued when the whole family went back to court. Judge Guffee ordered Tori and her parents (who were fostering the boys at the time) to all be drug tested. None of them had any history of drug use!</p>
<p>On the designated day, while Tori and her mom were getting drug tested, police arrived at the home with a new order from the judge and removed the children from their grandfather to state foster care.</p>
<p>As the police were driving Tori’s oldest son away, he reports they told him that they had to come and get him because his grandpa no longer wanted him.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>Tori, who had not been accused of any kind of abuse or neglect, </strong>
</span>who had already had to send her two little boys to her parents,<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong> now lost them to foster care with strangers.</strong>
</span>
</p>

<strong>
<img src="https://secure.parentalrights.org/neon/resource/parentalrights/images/SmallerImages/heart.png">Separating Innocent Families Does Far More Harm Than Good</strong>
</span>
<br>
Rosalind D. Folman in her journal article, <em>“I Was Tooken”: How Children Experience Removal from Their Parents Preliminary to Placement into Foster Care</em>, writes, “The events of the day of placement constitute a <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>crisis for the children</strong>
</span> because <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>everything in their lives changes</strong>
</span> and the <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>children are overwhelmed</strong>
</span> with feelings of abandonment, rejection, worthlessness, guilt, and helplessness.” (emphasis added) No wonder the boy was crushed by the officer’s words!</p>
<hr style="height: 1px; border: none; color: #1c8296; background-color: #1c8296;">
<p>
<span style="color: #1c8296;">
<strong>Tori Finally Got the Chance to Fight Back</strong>
</span>
<br>
She got an independent psychological evaluation, which she passed with flying colors. She gathered doctors, dentists, school records, report cards, and the high test scores of her two boys. She created an ironclad picture that she was not just a fit mom, but a great mom. DCS had no choice but to dismiss the case, and Judge Guffee returned the children to Harper.</p>

<strong>It’s Our Turn: Help Grow an Army Too Strong for Congress to Ignore</strong>
</span>
<br>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>This innocent, loving mom could have been any one of us! </strong>
</span>What happened to Tori and her family should never have happened in the first place, and <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>it should never happen to anyone again.</strong>
</span> That’s where the <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://parentalrights.org/amendment/">Parental Rights Amendment</a> comes in: it will elevate the level of respect for parents’ rights and make the standard clear.</p>
<p>We can never guarantee abuses of the system won’t take place, and this was clearly an abuse. There are many good investigators and good judges out there who would never treat an innocent family this way.</p>
<p>But we can make sure those who do commit these abuses can’t hide behind “qualified immunity” laws, claiming they didn’t know any better. The Parental Rights Amendment will leave them without excuse.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #1c8296;">
<strong>
<a href="https://parentalrights.org/amendment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
<img src="https://secure.parentalrights.org/neon/resource/parentalrights/images/SmallerImages/Amendment.jpg">
</a>
</strong>
</span>Last year, <strong>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">the Parental Rights Amendment was introduced in both houses of Congress </span>
</strong>for the first time since 2014. Now, we’re past the halfway point for this session and pushing harder than ever to move the Amendment forward. The clock is ticking!</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>So please take a moment right now</strong>
</span> <strong>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">to </span>
<a style="color: #cc7700;" href="http://citizengo.org/en-us/ed/116320-ask-your-representative-sponsor-parental-rights-amendment">sign the petition to Congress</a>
</strong> to pass the Parental Rights Amendment, and to <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>share Tori’s story</strong>
</span> with your family and friends, urging them to join you in supporting parental rights by <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="http://citizengo.org/en-us/ed/116320-ask-your-representative-sponsor-parental-rights-amendment">signing the petition as well.</a>
</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #1c8296;">
<strong>Together we can grow an army too strong for Congress to ignore</strong>
</span>, and with that army we can secure parental rights for ourselves and all future generations.</p>
<p>Thank you for standing with us.</p>

<p>Can a trip to the hospital turn into a custody battle? For Justina Pelletier and many other families, the answer has been, "Yes."</p>
<p>Michelle Malkin recently revisited the family of Justina Pelletier to expose this story we followed closely a few years ago: when a hospital calls in the state to override parental rights. It still matters now because, as Malkin states, <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>"It's still happening."</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>These short clips from the episode (the full episode is available on <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://www.crtv.com">CRTV.com</a>) share glimpses into parental rights (or lack thereof) in medical settings. We encourage you to watch them and to <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>share with your friends. </strong>
</span>Parents need to know what is happening.</p>
<p>As Michelle Malkin points out, "This is what I think is what is so shocking and chilling for any parent in America: That <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>they could bring their child in to be treated for the flu and then have that child stripped from them</strong>
</span>..."</p>
<p>Please <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>share with your friends</strong>
</span> and, if you're able, <strong>
<a style="color: #cc7700;">make a donation</a>
</strong> to help propel the <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://parentalrights.org/amendment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Parental Rights Amendment</a> forward. As Justina says in the last video above, this overreach <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>"has to stop." </strong>

<![CDATA[<p>
<em>Note: ParentalRights.org is not a “homeschool organization.” We support the right of all parents to direct the education, as well as the upbringing and care, of their children. But, as the recent Turpin case from California has prompted many to call for over-regulation of those who choose to homeschool, we felt a response was in order.</em>
</p>

<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>As details emerge from the Turpin story in California, many are calling for more regulation and government oversight </strong>
</span>of law-abiding homeschooling families. And while every one of us is horrified by the trauma these parents inflicted on their children, we must proceed with caution. <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>Answering tragedy with hysteria could lead to equally unwanted consequences.</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>The Turpins were registered as a private school under California law and claimed to be “homeschooling” their six school-aged children. Instead, they were abusing and neglecting their 13 children, ages 2 to 29, all of whom were found to be extremely malnourished. The details of the abuse cannot and should not be minimized. No child should ever have to endure what the Turpin children lived with for so long.</p>
<p>But should an entire population of nurturing, law-abiding homeschooling families be punished for the actions of one couple? That is what some are now proposing.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>Some argue that the state should intrude into all homeschooling families’ houses </strong>
</span>to take a look around and make sure no abuse is taking place. The state, they say, should make at least one or two visits every single year.</p>
<p>Non-homeschooling families have the peace of mind that a CPS worker won’t come knocking on their door at any moment throughout the year without provocation. But <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>homeschooling families would be robbed </strong>
</span>of this “private realm of family life which the state cannot enter.” <i>Prince v. Massachusetts</i>, <span class=".appleLinksBlack">321 U.S. 158 </span>(1944), at 166.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>And what about that investigator who is supposed to sign off on whether or not abuse is taking place?</strong>
</span> If he or she mistakenly concludes that nothing untoward is going on, there is always the possibility that something tragic could happen on his or her watch. On the other hand, saying there is abuse when in fact there is none has <i>no detrimental results</i> for the investigator. Suddenly, every homeschooling family looks like a potentially abusive household.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>The <i>vast majority</i> of parents who homeschool their children do so for a variety of moral, practical, and educational reasons. </strong>
</span>For many, it is enough that homeschooled students tend to score highly on educational placement tests and may turn out better adjusted for success after graduation. These parents choose to take on the immense task of homeschooling because they want the best education, leading to the best life possible for their children.</p>
<p>Yet, we are being asked to swallow a very different narrative: if families homeschool, they only do so to hide abuse. One pro-regulation organization even claimed abuse is “all too common” and “widespread” in homeschooling households, with no statistical evidence to back up the claim. Even the (also pro-regulation) editorial board of the <i>Sacramento Bee</i> wouldn’t buy that, recognizing that “such cases are not the norm for homeschools.”</p>
<p>To a school administrator or child services investigator, however, the solution is simple. Just get into the home of every family who homeschools, and we can save all the abused children.</p>
<p>So every family not in public school can expect that impending knock on the door, <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>along with the threat—spoken or unspoken—that their children could be taken away. </strong>
</span>Every cabinet and fridge will be opened, every decision questioned, every scrape or bruise made a cause for suspicion and alarm.</p>
<p>And in every such instance, in the name of preventing child abuse, <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>another child is subjected to trauma against their sense of continuity and security. </strong>
</span>“The younger the child, and the greater his own helplessness and dependence, the stronger is his need to experience his parents as his lawgivers—safe, reliable, all-powerful, and independent,” say Goldstein, Freud, and Solnit in their seminal series on the best interests of the child (Joseph Goldstein,<i> Before the Best Interests of the Child</i> (New York: The Free Press, 1979), p. 25).</p>
<p>But the cost to the innocent families is of no concern, apparently. They are just collateral damage in the war to ensure that evil never happens again.</p>
<p>It’s an approach more fitting of Orwell than of the American Constitution. The Supreme Court has held that “the statist notion that governmental power should supersede parental authority in all cases because some parents abuse and neglect children is repugnant to American tradition.” <i>Parham v. J.R.</i>, <span class=".appleLinksBlack">442 U.S. 584 </span>(1979), at 603.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>All children deserve to feel safe in their homes</strong>
</span>—safe from abuse, safe from unwarranted intrusion, and safe with their parents, period.</p>
<p>Child abuse is an outrage, and it must be stopped. But<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong> that cannot be achieved by traumatizing the millions of innocent homeschooled children </strong>
</span>who deserve to be taught in peace, free from the stress (or worse) that will arise from systematic government intrusion into their home.</p>
<p>

<![CDATA[<p>This first week of January one doesn’t have to look too far to see a reminder similar to this one: “It’s a brand new year, a clean slate, a chance to start over.” Unfortunately, <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>when it comes to your parental rights, we’re still dealing with the same reality we were a week ago</strong>
</span>, where your rights to make those vital decisions for your child too often depend on the good graces of someone—a doctor, a teacher, a social services investigator—who shouldn’t have that kind of power over your innocent family.</p>
<p>Now, all of these professions are worthy pursuits, and can play a key role in the very important task of catching or preventing actual child abuse or neglect. But too often a lax view of parental rights can lead to unwarranted intrusion into innocent families, as well.</p>
<p>
<a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://www.facebook.com/aKtionNow/videos/469390330098886/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
<img src="https://secure.parentalrights.org/neon/resource/parentalrights/images/SmallerImages/Screen%20Shot%202018-01-05%20at%202_35_27%20PM.png">
</a>
</p>
<p>
<a name="iq">
</a>
<span style="color: #1c8296;">
<strong>Couple Loses Custody Because State Officials Believe Not Smart Enough</strong>
</span>
<br>
Take, for instance, the case of Amy Fabbrini and Eric Ziegler of Redmond, Oregon, as recounted in a December 29 <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="http://www.intellectualtakeout.org/article/have-low-iq-government-can-take-your-child" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article at Intellectual Takeout</a>. Per that account, the couple lost custody of their two children, ages 10-months and 4-years, without ever being accused of abuse or neglect. Amy and Eric have been fighting for the right to raise their children for nearly 4 years—almost all of their oldest son’s life—<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>simply because state officials believe they are not smart enough to be parents.</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>Fabbrini’s IQ, according to the article, is 72, and Ziegler’s is 66. An average IQ is 100.</p>
<p>The couple have taken numerous nutrition and parenting classes mandated for them by the state in an effort to have their children returned. Consultation with an <a href="https://holistickenko.com/online-nutritionist/">online nutritionist</a> can help teach nutritional practices. </p>
<p>[Picture is of a news video on the story available <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://www.facebook.com/aKtionNow/videos/469390330098886/">here</a>.]</p>
<p>“They can’t win for losing,” Circuit Judge Bethany Flint, who returned the 10-month-old to his parents’ care recently, told the author of that article, “noting that the state appeared to be using Ziegler and Fabbrini’s efforts to cooperate as evidence they were unfit.”</p>
<p>Their older son, though, Flint left in state care, “noting that he has been diagnosed with certain developmental hurdles.”</p>
<p>What this couple needs most—and may well already have (the article does not say)—is a support network to help them. But the state’s determination to call them unfit simply due to who they are goes too far.</p>
<p>This is why the proposed Parental Rights Amendment provides that “the liberty of parents to direct the upbringing, education, and care of their child is a fundamental right,” and that “the parental rights guaranteed by this article shall not be denied or abridged on account of disability.”</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #1c8296;">
<strong>
<a style="color: #cc7700;" href="http://fox17.com/news/ferrier-files/ferrier-files-do-criminals-have-more-rights-than-parents-in-tennessee" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
<img src="https://secure.parentalrights.org/neon/resource/parentalrights/images/SmallerImages/Screen%20Shot%202018-01-05%20at%202_33_32%20PM.png">
</a>Children Taken from Mom Without Any Accusation of Abuse or Neglect</strong>
</span>
<br>
Or consider the case of Tori Harper, a divorcee in Tennessee who lost custody of her children, also without any accusation of abuse or neglect, when she called in to report that her “3-year-old son told her something inappropriate happened to him when he was with his father,” according to an article at <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="http://fox17.com/news/ferrier-files/ferrier-files-do-criminals-have-more-rights-than-parents-in-tennessee" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fox17 Nashville</a>.</p>
<p>The boys were returned to their mother after two months in state custody, but by all accounts they should never have been taken in the first place.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>“Criminals have more rights than parents,” </strong>
</span>Tori’s attorney Connie Reguli told the Fox news reporter. “Once they have your children in the system they are in total control…. And while this may have a happy ending, there are scars and trauma, real trauma.”</p>
<p>This is another reason we are working to enshrine parental rights in the text of the U.S. Constitution: so that no family court, and no case worker, can ignore the extremely important nature of the parent-child relationship.</p>
<hr>
<p>
<span style="color: #1c8296;">
<strong>We Need YOUR Help to Fix This</strong>
</span>
<br>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>Parents who have never been so much as accused of abuse or neglect should not have fewer rights than criminals charged with serious crimes. </strong>
</span>Instead, the proposed Amendment will command respect for this important parental role.</p>
<p>But we cannot hope to pass this measure without the growing support of the American people.</p>
<ul>
<li>

<span style="font-size: 22px;">
<strong>Special Year-End Edition</strong>
</span>
</span>
</p>
<p>Dear Champion of Parental Rights,</p>
<p>It has been a tough and at times scary year for parental rights, but as 2017 winds down, we have a lot to celebrate, too, including this exciting news<b>: </b>the Parental Rights Amendment has been introduced in both houses of Congress!</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>We are ending the year on a momentous note</strong>
</span>, and your continued support will help us keep our momentum going to gain new ground in our fight to protect children by empowering families.</p>
<p>Sadly, complete victory cannot come soon enough. Earlier this year, we were reminded of why we desperately need the Parental Rights Amendment right now, and just this month a new story has broken to reemphasize that fact.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>Parental rights are under attack from foreign governments and American elites who think they know best,</strong>
</span> and until now, there has been nothing standing in their way.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #1c8296;">
<strong>Remembering Charlie Gard</strong>
</span>
<br>
In international news, the tragic story of <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://parentalrights.org/tag/charlie-gard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Charlie Gard</a> showed us what can happen when parents do not have legal protection from government interference.</p>
<p>When only a few months old, British baby Charlie was diagnosed with an extremely rare genetic disorder that affected his breathing capabilities and brain functions. His doctors were pessimistic, but his parents wanted a second opinion. An experimental treatment in the U.S. showed promise for greatly extending the life of children like Charlie.</p>
<p>But the courts wouldn’t let the parents intervene. Though they raised more than $1.7 million in private funds, the 11-month-old’s mom and dad were <i>denied the right</i> to get a second opinion, to secure experimental treatment, or even to take their son home to die.</p>
<p>Charlie’s parents simply wanted to do what they thought was best for their baby boy. But the powers-that-be, the European courts and British government, said no. In Europe, the government thinks they—not parents—know what’s best for children.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #1c8296;">
<strong>
<img src="https://secure.parentalrights.org/neon/resource/parentalrights/images/SmallerImages/alfie-1.jpg">Baby Alfie’s Struggle</strong>
</span>
<br>
Now, poor baby Alfie and his parents are in the midst of a repeat of that very same struggle in Great Britain. Unlike Charlie Gard, however, Alfie is not terminally ill. In fact, he has no diagnosis at all. Doctors don’t know what is wrong with him, but they are ready to pull the plug, even over the objections of Alfie’s loving parents!</p>
<p>For the parents, this is Charlie Gard all over again!</p>
<p>
<em>Picture from <u>
<a style="color: #5e5d5d;" href="https://twitter.com/Alfiesarmy16" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#ALFIESARMY Twitter page</a>
</u>; used with permission.</em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<span style="color: #1c8296;">It Could Happen Here</span>
</strong>
<br>
Right now,<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<b> there’s nothing in the Constitution to specifically prevent a similar, heartbreaking story from happening right here in America, even in your own community.</b>
</span>
</p>
<p>It’s too late to save Charlie and there’s little that American law can do for Alfie, but the Parental Rights Amendment would protect your children and mine from the dire consequences that come from an overreaching government insistent on denying our parental rights.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>That is why we must act now.</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>2017 also showed us that this radical ideology, which says government knows better than parents, is <i>already here in the United States</i>. It’s being taught in our most prestigious universities by the likes of Professor James Dwyer.</p>
<p>
<a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://parentalrights.org/dwyer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
<img src="https://secure.parentalrights.org/neon/resource/parentalrights/images/SmallerImages/Screen%20Shot%202017-12-11%20at%203_26_00%20PM.png">
</a>In a <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://parentalrights.org/dwyer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent interview</a>, Dwyer said that <span style="color: #cc7700;">“<b>the reason the parent-child relationships <i>exists</i> is because the <i>State</i> confers legal parenthood on people through its paternity and maternity laws.”</b>
</span>
</p>
<p>Dwyer is a distinguished family law professor who has been praised by his colleagues for his work. He has even received numerous awards as an “expert” in his field. But if what he teaches is adopted by the hundreds of students who sit in his classroom, there will be disastrous consequences.</p>
<p>Dwyer thinks that the only reason that you or I get to be parents is because the “State” allows us to!</p>
<p>This would be shocking enough if Dwyer were the only one who believed in this dangerous ideology. But he’s not alone. His poisonous views are respected and shared by many American jurists and academics. His radical way of thinking is being embraced by the next generation of judges who may very well decide the fate of our families in the near future.</p>
<p>These elites believe they know better than families, but the truth is that the spread of this toxic ideology will produce catastrophic damage to parents and children nationwide.</p>
<p>What happened to Charlie Gard and is happening to Alfie, plus these public statements by Professor Dwyer, show that<b> <span style="color: #cc7700;">the need to pass a Parental Rights Amendment has never been greater. </span>
</b>
</p>
<p>Such looming threats to families and children were not always a concern, though. Prior to 2000, parents enjoyed constitutional protection from the government and other outside entities.</p>
<p>Then, years of court precedent and assumptions were changed by <i>Troxel v. Granville.</i> The Supreme Court’s decision erased the traditional high level of constitutional protection for fundamental parental rights, leaving families vulnerable to unwarranted government interference.</p>
<p>Ever since, judges have had leeway to let the State override the rights of parents to raise their children, of course at the discretion of the court. The ideas of those like Dwyer who hold that government knows best—the belief that leaves Alfie’s parents on the outside looking in—are getting free rein in too many U.S. courts.</p>
<p>Every instance makes the future of parental rights seem grim. Foreign governments that let children die on their watch, lauded American professors who believe in the State’s absolute power over parents—these are bleak moments in the fight for parental rights.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #1c8296;">
<strong>Closer Than Ever to Winning – But Time Is Short!</strong>
</span>
<b> </b>
<br>
Yet, the truth is we are closer than ever to winning this fight, to passing the Parental Rights Amendment once and for all.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>Because of your faithful support, we’ve never been in a better position to accomplish our mission.</strong>
</span> But we still need <i>you</i> to reach the finish line.</p>
<p>This summer, Sen. Lindsey Graham introduced the Amendment as Senate Joint Resolution 48, alongside Sen. Blunt (R-MO), Sen. Grassley (R-IA), Sen. Isakson (R-GA), Sen. Risch (R-ID), and Sen. Rubio (R-FL).</p>
<p>Then just before Thanksgiving, Rep. Randy Hultgren introduced House Joint Resolution 121. He was joined by 15 original cosponsors at the time of introduction, and more representatives are expressing support every day.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://secure.parentalrights.org/neon/resource/parentalrights/images/SmallerImages/hourglass.jpg">
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>The Amendment is now ready to go in both chambers of Congress,</strong>
</span> but we have also reached the halfway point of this session; <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>time is short and the clock is ticking!</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>Because of your willingness to stand with us, we have already come so far. This year, we have seen interest for the Amendment grow on both sides of the aisle. Our online presence has increased and our strategic plans have evolved to reach as many people as possible.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>But the toughest battle is what comes next. </strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>In order to pass through the House, the Amendment will need two-thirds of the Representatives to vote in favor of it. In order to accomplish this, <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>we need your help to increase our grassroots network and ramp up our lobbying efforts.</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">Will you give your very </span>
<a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://parentalrights.org/donate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
<span style="color: #cc7700;">best gift today</span>
</a>

<p>P.S. ParentalRights.org truly made tremendous strides over the past year. Thanks to your dedication, I believe <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>we’re closer than ever to passing the Parental Rights Amendment. </strong>
</span>As the end of the year rapidly approaches, I hope that I can count on your continued support. <strong>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">Please consider giving your </span>
<a style="color: #cc7700;" href="http://parentalrights.org/donate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
<span style="color: #cc7700;">most generous gift</span>
</a>
</strong> to make a vital difference towards protecting children by empowering parents.</p>
<p>P.P.S. For donors to both organizations: As you plan your giving, please be aware that, with nearly all our resources focused on lobbying Congress for the Parental Rights Amendment, we will not be sending a year-end letter for the <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="http://www.parentalrightsfoundation.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Parental Rights Foundation</a> this year.</p>

</p>
<p>As the <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://parentalrights.org/tag/charlie-gard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tragedy of Charlie Gard’s death</a> unfolded—that’s the terminally-ill 11-month-old from the United Kingdom whose parents in July were prohibited from transferring him to a U.S. hospital for life-saving treatment, or even from taking him home to die—I remember taking some small comfort from the thought, “This is a rare case. This is something that won’t happen again anytime soon.”</p>
<p>I was sadly and unimaginably wrong about that.</p>
<p>
<a href="twitter.com/Alfiesarmy16/status/936351196771692544" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
<img src="https://secure.parentalrights.org/neon/resource/parentalrights/images/SmallerImages/Screen%20Shot%202017-12-08%20at%201_24_33%20PM.png">
</a>
<a style="color: #cc7700;" href="http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/454446/another-uk-hospital-no-baby-transfer-end-life-support" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alfie Evans</a> is an 18-month-old in another United Kingdom hospital—Ader Hey Children’s. <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>As in the case of Charlie Gard, the hospital has given up on Alfie. </strong>
</span>They can’t sort out what’s wrong with him; he has been in a coma for a year, and they don’t even have a diagnosis.</p>
<p>[<em>Picture Credit: Pictures from <a href="https://twitter.com/Alfiesarmy16" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#ALFIESARMY Twitter page</a>; used with permission. Visit <a href="https://twitter.com/Alfiesarmy16" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#ALFIESARMY</a> to view the video and learn more.]</em>
</p>
<p>Alfie moves, shows expression, and exhibits signs of life, based on several videos posted online, including this <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://twitter.com/Alfiesarmy16/status/936351196771692544" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video posted on Twitter</a>. But doctors have decided it is in his best interest to simply end his life.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>Alfie’s parents, Thomas Evans and Kate James, are crushed.</strong>
</span> And well they should be. After months of efforts, they have finally found a hospital in Italy that wants to take over Alfie’s care and try to find a solution.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://twitter.com/Alfiesarmy16" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
<img src="https://secure.parentalrights.org/neon/resource/parentalrights/images/SmallerImages/alfie-with-parents.jpg">
</a>Only, Ader Hey’s staff would rather petition the court to declare it in Alfie’s best interest that they turn off his ventilator and end intensive care than see him transferred out of their control. <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>And in the United Kingdom, they have the legal power to do just that.</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>Fortunately for us, our own legal system is not yet that far gone on the issue of parental rights. But if scholars and teachers like <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://parentalrights.org/dwyer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">James Dwyer</a> at the William and Mary School of Law get their way, or if doctors like those who “treated” <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://www.crtv.com/video/s2e08--medical-kidnapping--is-your-child-the-next-justina-part-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Justina Pelletier</a> at Boston Children’s Hospital get their way, then <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>we won’t be far behind.</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>The proposed Parental Rights Amendment to the U.S. Constitution can halt that progression in its tracks. </strong>
</span>By declaring in the Constitution that “the liberty of parents to direct the upbringing, education, and care of their children is a fundamental right,” the Amendment will serve as a giant “stop sign” to government interference. By enshrining these traditional, natural, God-given rights in the text of the Constitution, we can restrict the government from overriding them just because some doctor or hospital (or law professor, for that matter) thinks they know best.</p>
<p>We will be closely monitoring Alfie’s fate, and we will keep you posted on his parents’ battle to save his life.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, though, Congress is about to recess for the holidays, and many have still not signed on to cosponsor this vital Amendment.</p>
<p>Thursday is scheduled to be their last day in this first session of the 115th Congress.  And that means we have only 3 or 4 more days to reach out and urge them to cosponsor the Parental Rights Amendment—H.J. Res. 121 in the House, and S.J. Res. 48 in the Senate—before the long holiday break.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we have added 4 new cosponsors since the introduction of H.J. Res. 121 only three weeks ago, and that means <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>our calls are working.</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #1c8296;">
<strong>***Take Action ***</strong>
</span>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<span style="color: #1c8296;">
<strong>Call: </strong>
</span>Please take a moment right now to <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://parentalrights.org/states/contact-your-representatives/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">call your congressman and your two senators</a> and urge them to sign on. Let them know you don’t want hospitals and courts making medical decisions for your child like Alfie Evans’s parents are experiencing in the U.K. today. Tell them it is time to shut and lock the door on any chance of that kind of nightmare coming to America.</li>
<li>
<span style="color: #1c8296;">
<strong>Give: </strong>
</span>Please remember the children by <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://parentalrights.org/donate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">including ParentalRights.org when you plan your end-of-year giving this year. </a>Every dollar you give will help us empower the parents to save children just like these.</li>
</ol>
<p>By standing together to pass the Parental Rights Amendment, we can demonstrate to the world that loving parents, not government courts, are best suited to know what is in the best interests of their child. Thank you for standing with us!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Thanks to you, our amazing supporters, <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>November was a tremendous month for ParentalRights.org. </strong>
</span>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Though the <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://parentalrights.org/donate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">giving season</a> has just begun, <strong>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">your generosity on </span>
<a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://parentalrights.org/givingtuesday/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
<span style="color: #cc7700;">#GivingTuesday</span>
</a>
<span style="color: #cc7700;"> was overwhelming, </span>
</strong>surpassing our goal by more than 60%!</li>
<li>
<strong>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">Our new </span>
<a style="color: #cc7700;" href="http://www.citizengo.org/en-us/ed/116320-ask-your-representative-sponsor-parental-rights-amendment">
<span style="color: #cc7700;">CitizenGO petition</span>
</a> </strong>has allowed us to reach more concerned Americans with word about the threat to parental rights and the solution offered through the Parental Rights Amendment.</li>
<li>And, of course, we saw <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>the Amendment itself introduced</strong>
</span> by Rep. Randy Hultgren and 15 original cosponsors (<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>now up to 17!</strong>
</span>) as H.J. Res. 121 in the U.S. House.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, like you, we are getting ready for that time of year when things seem to both get busier and slow down for the holidays. (How does that always seem to happen?)</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #1c8296;">
<strong>***Action: Call Before Congress Heads Home***</strong>
</span>
<br>
But before that break, we want this session of Congress to finish well for parents. And that means <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>taking one more opportunity to contact your lawmakers </strong>
</span>about supporting the Parental Rights Amendment before they also go home for the holidays.</p>
<p>So please take just a moment right now, before you close this email, to <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://parentalrights.org/news/current/#currenthouse" target="_blank" rel="noopener">call your member of Congress</a> and ask them to sign on with Rep. Randy Hultgren as a cosponsor of H.J. Res. 121, the Parental Rights Amendment. It will only take a moment, but a lot of calls will be needed to cut through the din of tax reform on Capitol Hill. And each new cosponsor can move us closer to hearings in the Constitution Subcommittee and the House Judiciary Committee—both necessary next steps in the process.</p>
<p>Then take one more minute to <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://parentalrights.org/news/current/#currentsenate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">urge your two senators</a> to sign on to S.J. Res. 48 with Senator Lindsey Graham.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #1c8296;">
<strong>***Action: Continue to Remember the Children***</strong>
</span>
<br>
And, of course, if you would continue to remember the children and<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong> <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://parentalrights.org/donate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support ParentalRights.org with your end-of-year giving</a>
</strong>
</span>, that will empower success as well by allowing us to do even more to push the Amendment forward.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #1c8296;">
<strong>***Moving Forward to the Next Team Victory**</strong>
</span>
<br>
Together we can protect this and future generations of children by preserving the parental role with the Parental Rights Amendment. <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>Thank you for standing with us</strong>
</span> and playing a part in our next major team victory!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<span style="color: #c02033;">Thanks to You, We Did It…and More!</span>
</span>
</strong>
</p>
<p>Thanks to you and more than 100 generous donors across the country, plus a gracious $5,000 matching grant from <a style="color: #c02033;" href="http://DonHoweSuccess.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DonHoweSuccess.com</a>, we were able not only to reach our $10,000 #GivingTuesday goal, but even to surpass our $15,000 “stretch goal.”</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #c02033;">
<strong>In the end, the campaign raised $16,542 </strong>
</span>to protect our children by securing our rights through the Parental Rights Amendment.</p>
<p>Along the way, we discovered our own Will Estrada and Maggie McKneely make a nice on-air team, too, as they hosted our video segments from the Capitol on Facebook Live. (You can still view them all on our <a style="color: #c02033;" href="https://www.facebook.com/parentalrights.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook page</a>.)</p>
<p>Will and Maggie also got to announce the winners of our give-aways during their segments, as well as the winning donation-bid on the autographed football from Shaun Alexander. <span style="color: #c02033;">
<strong>Congratulations to all of our winners; </strong>
</span>we will get those prizes mailed this week and on their way!</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #c02033;">
<strong>But here’s the most amazing thing: </strong>
</span>neither our online fun nor even the money coming in, as important as that is to sustaining our effort, was the most exciting thing happening in the last few days. During this effort, we’ve seen our reach grow through social media, our website, and especially our new <a style="color: #c02033;" href="http://citizengo.org/en-us/ed/116320-ask-your-representative-sponsor-parental-rights-amendment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CitizenGO campaign</a>. That means more people talking about parental rights and more people reaching out to their congressmen.</p>
<p>So let me encourage you, now that the donation drive is through, <span style="color: #c02033;">
<strong>to take another moment to pass the word to your friends and family to join that <a style="color: #c02033;" href="http://citizengo.org/en-us/ed/116320-ask-your-representative-sponsor-parental-rights-amendment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CitizenGO petition</a>. </strong>
</span>And then take one more minute to <a style="color: #c02033;" href="https://parentalrights.org/news/current/#currenthouse" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contact your U.S. representative</a> and ask him or her to cosponsor the Parental Rights Amendment, <a style="color: #c02033;" href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-joint-resolution/121/cosponsors?r=37&amp;overview=closed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">H.J. Res. 121</a>, sponsored by Rep. Randy Hultgren.</p>
<p>We are overjoyed with this showing of generosity for parental rights yesterday. Now let’s start putting your investment to work today!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Will you “remember the Children” by <a style="color: #c02033;" href="http://parentalrights.org/givingtuesday" target="_blank" rel="noopener">helping us reach our 1-day donation goal of $10,000</a> to promote the Parental Rights Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, now in both chambers of Congress?</p>
<p>You recognize, as we do, that the very best way to protect children is by preserving their right to be raised by the parents who love them. <span style="color: #c02033;">
<strong>Every day, too many children are removed from their homes just because someone else thinks <i>they</i> know better.</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>And you know there is no better way to protect these children than by empowering their parents through the Parental Rights Amendment.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Dear Champion of Parental Rights,</p>
<p>I wanted to share an exciting update with you. This afternoon, <span style="color: #f28d05;">
<strong>the Parental Rights Amendment was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives! </strong>
</span>Congressman Randy Hultgren (R-IL 14), the lead sponsor of the resolution, was joined by 15 original cosponsors when he submitted the Amendment.</p>
<p>The Amendment has been numbered H.J. Res. 121. The Senate version, SJ Res. 48, was introduced in August by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC).</p>

<p align="center">
<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 18px;">
<strong>
<a style="color: #ffffff; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://parentalrights.org/pra-introduced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
<span style="color: #ffffff; text-decoration: underline;">View and share the Press Release.</span> </a>
</strong>
</span>
</p>

<p>The introduction of the Parental Rights Amendment in <span style="color: #f28d05;">
<strong>both houses </strong>
</span>marks a significant step forward, and <span style="color: #f28d05;">
<strong>we could never have come so far without your support!</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>“We’re coming up on half-time in this Congress,” says Jim Mason, president of ParentalRights.org. “We are working to get a member of Congress from every state to become a co-sponsor in an effort to gain a hearing in the appropriate committees.”</p>
<p>Rep. Steve King (R-IA 4), the chairman of the subcommittee to which the House version has been assigned, is a long-time friend to parental rights. We are encouraged by our chances of getting a hearing on his schedule, which is the next step in the process.</p>
<p>This is a tremendous opportunity, and <span style="color: #f28d05;">
<strong>you are responsible for making it happen! </strong>
</span>
</p>

<p align="center">
<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 18px;">
<strong>
<a style="color: #ffffff; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGpIfqlKB4o" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
<span style="color: #ffffff; text-decoration: underline;">View and share this fun intro video from a daughter of one of our team members.</span> </a>
</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p align="center">
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGpIfqlKB4o">
<strong>
<span style="font-size: 18px;">
<span style="color: #ffffff;">

</span>
</span>
</strong>
</a>
</p>

<p>Now, we need your continued support. “We need our friends and supporters to call their Congress member’s D.C. and district offices and encourage them to cosponsor H.J. Res. 121. We need people to write or visit their congressman. And those who can, give,” says Mason.</p>
<p>To clear the House, the Amendment will need a two-thirds super-majority vote. To clear that hurdle, our voices alone will not be enough.</p>
<p>To accomplish this, <span style="color: #f28d05;">
<strong>we urgently need to ramp up our grassroots efforts and increase our public reach</strong>
</span>, as well as preparing for hearings in both House and Senate committees. These involve necessary expenses going forward, but success begins with <a style="color: #f28d05;" href="https://parentalrights.org/news/current/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
<strong>your phone calls right now.</strong>
</a>
</p>
<p>Could you take a moment right now to <a style="color: #f28d05;" href="https://parentalrights.org/news/current/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
<strong>call your representat</strong>ive</a> and urge them to sign on as a cosponsor today? Then, if you can, take another moment to<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <strong>
<a style="color: #f28d05; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://secure.parentalrights.org/np/clients/parentalrights/donation.jsp?campaign=5&amp;=&amp;utm_source=website&amp;utm_campaign=house" target="_blank" rel="noopener">give to ParentalRights.org</a>
</strong>
</span>. We are committed to pressing forward to secure our parental rights, and <span style="color: #f28d05;">
<strong>your support can help fuel the fight.</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>This afternoon’s introduction is <span style="color: #f28d05;">
<strong>only the beginning of what we can achieve together</strong>
</span> if we remain faithful to the cause and make our voices known! Thank you for standing with us as always!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<span style="color: #cc7700;">This #GivingTuesday, remember the children!</span>

</p>
<p>
<strong>
<span style="color: #81452b;">Some nations believe the State knows better than parents what is best for children.</span> </strong>(See<em> <a href="https://parentalrights.org/charlie-gard-coming-america/" data-cke-saved-href="https://parentalrights.org/charlie-gard-coming-america/">Charlie Gard</a>
</em>) And while we want to believe that ideology could never come to America, there are already academics here, like <a href="https://parentalrights.org/dwyer/" data-cke-saved-href="https://parentalrights.org/dwyer/">Professor James Dwyer</a> at William and Mary, teaching the very same thing.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, studies consistently show that children do better in their own homes with their own parents than when they are taken away by the State.</p>
<p>That’s why we need the Parental Rights Amendment!</p>










<p>
<strong>Exciting Update (11/27):</strong> We’ve just received great news: DonHoweSuccess.com has offered to match up to $5,000. That means for every dollar you give, ParentalRights.org will receive $2—all the way up to our $10,000 goal!</p>










<p>So this Giving Tuesday (coming November 28), we invite you to keep in mind that the first step to protecting and providing for children is, whenever possible, to keep them in the care of parents who love them.</p>
<p>As you plan your giving, <span style="color: #81452b;">
<strong>plan to protect children by empowering parents with your generous donation to ParentalRights.org.</strong>
</span> Take steps now—and plan again for later—to encourage your friends on social media to give, too. (Simply <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://parentalrights.org/givingtuesday/">share our #GivingTuesday page</a> with them.)</p>
<p>
<strong>
<span style="color: #81452b;">Our goal is to raise $10,000 in one day</span>
</strong> to fuel support for the Parental Rights Amendment in the U.S. House, the Senate, and in as many states as possible.</p>

</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Representative Randy Hultgren (R-IL) introduced legislation in the U.S. House to propose a Parental Rights Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.</li>
<li>Hultgren’s House Joint Resolution 121 had 15 original cosponsors at its introduction on Thursday, November 16.</li>
<li>A parallel resolution, SJRes. 48, was introduced in the Senate by Sen. Lindsey Graham in August.</li>
<li>The Amendment, which would provide that “[t]he liberty of parents to direct the upbringing, education, and care of their children is a fundamental right,” requires a two-thirds vote in each house of Congress to go to the states for ratification. This means bipartisan support will be necessary for its passage.</li>

<![CDATA[<p>Dear Champion of Parental Rights,</p>
<p>In the halls of one of America’s oldest and most prestigious universities, your <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>parental rights are under attack.</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b>“The reason the parent-child relationships <i>exists</i> is because the <i>State</i> confers legal parenthood on people through its paternity and maternity laws.”</b>
</p>
<p>This recent comment comes from an interview with distinguished law professor James Dwyer, the Arthur B. Hanson and Cabell Research Professor of Law at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia. Professor Dwyer is a leading academic voice who sincerely holds that parental rights are given to us <i>only by the State</i>.</p>
<p>Dwyer, who teaches family law, also believes that there is no such thing as fundamental parental rights; it is the State that gets to make every major decision in a child’s life, <i>not the parents</i>.</p>
<p>In the same interview, Dwyer claimed,</p>
<p>“<b>It’s the state that is empowering parents to do anything – to take [children] home, have custody, and make any decisions about that.”</b>
</p>
<p>He believes you have no rights unless the State gives them to you. And you can actually lose your rights before you ever take your child home from the hospital!</p>
<p>Dwyer genuinely believes that the <b>“state needs to be the ultimate guarantor of a child’s well-being.” </b>He wants parents – he wants <i>you and me</i>– to be removed from the equation.</p>
<p>He thinks government can do a better job of raising children. But you and I both know that he’s wrong.</p>
<p>We know that when a parent loses their rights, it’s often the child who truly suffers. Children with proper parental support are more likely to have higher grades, better health, and possess greater social competence. In fact, children who grow up with loving and committed parents are less likely to smoke, drink, use drugs, or end up in jail.</p>
<p>Parental involvement is key to a child’s future success. Even the Supreme Court has held that <b>“<i>the child and his parents share</i> a vital interest in preventing erroneous termination of their <i>natural relationship</i>.” </b>
<i>Santosky v. Kramer</i> 455 US. 745 (1982) at 760 (emphasis added).</p>
<p>However, as parents, our rights are not safe from erroneous attacks and dangerous, radical ideologies like those of Professor Dwyer. In fact, across America today, too many families have seen Dwyer’s ideas acted out by Child Protective Services.</p>
<p>We’ve seen children ripped away from healthy, happy homes without cause by over-zealous child services investigators who think they know best. And the result is predictably the same: broken homes, and broken children who grow up to have broken homes of their own.</p>
<p>
<b>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">But together we are changing this story thanks to your generous support of ParentalRights.org.</span> </b>
</p>
<p>For more than 25 years, Dwyer has been spreading his convoluted logic through articles, books, and courtroom and TV appearances. And instead of being criticized for his <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<b>radical and dangerous </b>
</span>ideas, Dwyer is praised by his colleagues for his work. He has actually received numerous awards as an “expert” in family law.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>Now he’s influencing the next generation of family court lawyers and judges in the classroom. </strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>There are already many academics and politicians who agree with him. Too many are saying that the government can raise children better than parents can.</p>
<p>As an American and as a parent, I am concerned about the spread of this toxic and dangerous ideology that will inevitably produce catastrophic damage.</p>
<p>Imagine a court system where family law practitioners don’t believe you should choose what school your child goes to. Or what religion your family practices. Or even whether someone else should raise your child.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<b>Or imagine a system so powerful they can take away your children at any time, without you ever getting a day in court at all.</b>
</span>
</p>
<p>If Dwyer’s radical beliefs are adopted nationwide, that is their natural conclusion.</p>
<p>But you and I know something that Professor Dwyer just won’t admit. We know that children are better off when parents, and <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>not the government</strong>
</span>, direct their upbringing.</p>
<p>There is good news, though. Together you and I can actually <i>halt</i> Dwyer’s assault on our families before it gets too far.</p>
<p>With the Parental Rights Amendment, we can make sure that our parental rights cannot be trampled on by a government that thinks it knows best how to raise your kids.</p>
<p>That’s why my team is hard at work to secure your rights and make sure that children nationwide are able to benefit from their parents’ loving care.</p>
<p>I am proud to announce that this summer the Parental Rights Amendment was introduced in Congress as Senate Joint Resolution 48 by Senator Lindsey Graham. He was joined by five additional senators as original cosponsors: Sen. Blunt (R-MO), Sen. Grassley (R-IA), Sen. Isakson (R-GA), Sen. Risch (R-ID), and Sen. Rubio (R-FL). What’s more, we’ve confirmed that re-introduction of the Amendment in the House is slated to happen within the month!</p>
<p>This introduction in both houses is a giant step towards protecting your fundamental rights from people like James Dwyer. That is why we urgently need your help to advance the bill in Congress this fall.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<b>Such advancements and victories would simply not be possible without your continued support.</b>
</span>
</p>
<p>Unlike many political organizations, ParentalRights.org is led by a passionate group of parents <i>like you</i>, who are committed to fight for our parental rights! We are able to continue the fight for our Parental Rights thanks to the faithful financial support of our partners across the country. <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>Together, we are truly making history!</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>Thanks to you, we’ve had an exciting and momentous year so far. But our work isn’t done. Comments like Dwyer’s remind us that we must <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>continue to fight</strong>
</span> against beliefs that would erode your right to be a parent.</p>
<p>Right now we are preparing for the <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<b>introduction of the Parental Rights Amendment in the House of Representatives. </b>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b>

</span>
</a>
</b> to help us in Congress to combat Dwyer’s dangerous ideology?</p>
<p>With your help, ParentalRights.org is continuing to stand up against the encroaching power of government. We will fight back against those who say that your rights come from the State. And we will be able to win those vital victories that push the Amendment forward.</p>
<p>

</span>
</p>
<p>Thank you for your commitment to the fight. It is truly an honor to serve your family and fight for your rights!</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br>

<br>
James Mason<br>
President</p>
<p>P.S. – Distinguished law professor James Dwyer is teaching future lawyers and judges that parents don’t have a fundamental right to parent. Fortunately, we can protect families from this dangerous ideology. With the Parental Rights Amendment, you and I can ensure that our rights are secured against the radical belief that parenthood is a favor endowed by the government. <strong>

<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>Keep calling your congressman! </strong>
</span>In the first three days of calls last week, <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>we added four original cosponsors</strong>
</span> to the <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://parentalrights.org/amendment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Parental Rights Amendment</a> in the House, and though calls have let up, we have added another since then.</p>
<p>Currently joining lead sponsor Randy Hultgren (R-IL) on the PRA resolution are Reps. Jeff Duncan (R-SC), Tim Budd (R-NC), Kristi Noem (R-SD), Tim Walberg (R-MI), and Barbara Comstock (R-VA).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<img src="https://parentalrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/current.png">
</p>
<p>This is a terrific start, but <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<b>time is running out for your lawmaker to be an “original cosponsor.”</b> </span>(They can sign on as a cosponsor any time, but only those signed on at the time of its introduction are “original cosponsors.”) We anticipate Rep. Hultgren will introduce the measure as early as Friday, so to be an “original” your representative will have to move fast!</p>
<p>As a reminder, here’s what you need to do to make your voice heard. And if you already called last week but your lawmaker hasn’t signed on yet, go ahead and call them again; there’s a lot to be said for persistence!</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<b>And please call no matter what the political party of your congressman. </b> </span>This is an issue that matters to us all and truly reaches across the aisle.</p>

<p>
<b>Call Instructions</b>
</p>
<p>First, call you congressman’s D.C. phone number, available on <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://www.house.gov/representatives/find/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">House.gov</a> or by calling the Capitol Switchboard at 202.224.3121.</p>
<p>Then, tell their staff you are calling to urge your lawmaker to sign on with Randy Hultgren as an original cosponsor of the Parental Rights Amendment. Your natural, God-given right to raise your child is at risk in the courts, and this Amendment is necessary to see that liberty is protected at the level it—and you and your children—deserve.</p>
<p>Finally, <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<b>tell them time is running out.</b> </span>Rep. Hultgren is introducing the bill within the next couple of days, and you’d really like your congressman to be signed on when that happens.</p>
<p>Then, as always, thank them for taking your call. Remember to be courteous whenever you call; it’s the best way to get results!</p>

<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>Please take the time to call right now, before you move on to something else.</strong>
</span> And thank you for standing with us—for calling with us!—to protect parental rights!</p>

<h1 class="title style-scope ytd-video-primary-info-renderer">Exciting News:<br>
It's Time to Act!</h1>
<p>Great news! <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>Rep. Randy Hultgren (R-IL) has announced he is ready to introduce the Parental Rights Amendment </strong>
</span>in the U.S. House of Representatives. This means the PRA will soon have been proposed in both chambers of Congress; Sen. Lindsey Graham has already submitted companion resolution <a href="https://parentalrights.org/prasintro17/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">S.J.Res. 48 in the Senate.</a>
</p>
<p>Before the resolution’s introduction in early November, Rep. Hultgren (and ParentalRights.org!) <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>would like to get a good number of initial cosponsors</strong>
</span>—members of the House who join him on the bill right from the start—<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>preferably from both political parties. </strong>
</span>After all, parental rights is not an issue only for one side of the aisle, and either party would be foolish to yield the issue entirely to their opponents.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">So this is where you and I come in:</span> </strong>I am about to contact my member of Congress, and I urge you to do the same. <strong>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">Take a moment <em>right now</em>,</span> </strong>before you close this email, to call your representative and ask that they join Rep. Hultrgen as an original cosponsor of the Parental Rights Amendment.</p>

<strong>Get Your Congressman to Sign On</strong>
</span>
<br>
Here’s all you need to do:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>
<span style="color: #1c8296;">Call your member of Congress.</span> </strong>You can <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://www.house.gov/representatives/find/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">find your representative's information</a> by inputting your zip code on the House website, or you can call the Capitol Switchboard at <span class="appleLinksOrange">202.224.3121</span> and ask them to connect you.</li>
<li>
<span style="color: #1c8296;">
<strong>Let your congressman’s office know</strong>
</span> that Randy Hultgren of Illinois will be introducing the Parental Rights Amendment to the U.S. Constitution very soon, and that you want your lawmaker to sign on right away as an original cosponsor. You might also add a little something about why you support the Parental Rights Amendment, but if you’re not comfortable with that, it’s okay. They will generally respond to the number of calls they get, even if you don’t share your story with them. Note: Some staff will ask you for a bill number; remind them that we’re gathering original cosponsors, so there is no bill number yet.</li>
<li>
<span style="color: #1c8296;">
<strong>Invite them to contact Rep. Randy Hultgren’s office</strong> </span>or ParentalRights.org if they have any questions about the Amendment. If they wish to contact us, they can email Director of Government Relations Will Estrada at <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="mailto:Will@parentalrights.org">Will@parentalrights.org</a> or Director of Communications Michael Ramey (me) at <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="mailto:Michael@parentalrights.org">Michael@parentalrights.org</a> or call me at <span class="appleLinksOrange">540.751.1247.</span>
</li>
</ol>
<p>And that’s it. It really is that simple.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>It will only take about 2 minutes, </strong>
</span>but the impact on our future and our children’s future when the PRA passes could be absolutely huge.</p>
<p>Then, if you’d like to know when your call has had an effect, you can visit our <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://parentalrights.org/states/contact-your-representatives#currenthouse" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Contact Congress</a> page, where we will keep an updated list of those who have signed on with Rep. Hultgren. Even Congress’s website won’t have that list until the resolution is officially introduced in November, but we will stay in touch with the congressman’s office to keep you updated practically in real time.</p>
<hr style="border-color: #1c8296;">
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>Thank you for taking a moment today to make this vital phone call to your U.S. Representative. </strong>
</span>Together we can give the Parental Rights Amendment the great bipartisan start it needs in the U.S. House!</p>

<![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;">
<em>Photo of Maryanne Godboldo from <a style="color: #5e5d5d;" href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/Jstice4Maryanne/photos/?tab=album&amp;album_id=178678672179603" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@Jstice4Maryanne</a>

</p>
<p>Maryanne Godboldo, the Detroit mother who <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>faced down a SWAT team to protect her daughter </strong>
</span>from a dangerous psychotropic drug, has died, <em>
<a style="color: #cc7700;" href="http://detne.ws/2wSMbc5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Detroit News</a>
</em> reports.</p>
<p>Godboldo first drew national attention to the plight of parents in March 2011 when Detroit police and child services workers came for her child. Godboldo had previously reached out to local services for help in getting Risperdol, a costly anti-psychotic medicine, for her daughter, Ariana. But when she saw the effects the drug was having on the teen–including violent tendencies–Maryann decided to cut the treatment.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hIlo7KD2L0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
<img src="https://parentalrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/maryanne-godboldo-swat.jpeg">
</a>Unhappy about her decision, a child services investigator led police to the family home </strong>
</span>to take Ariana into custody. When Godboldo refused them access, a SWAT team was called in, shots were allegedly fired, and a <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hIlo7KD2L0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10-hour stand-off</a> ensued.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, a family friend who was also a judge persuaded Godboldo to end the impasse, a move the judge later said she would not have made has she known all the facts. The court order used by workers to take Ariana had been literally rubber-stamped with a judge’s signature. No judge has seen or actually signed the order.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://secure.parentalrights.org/neon/resource/parentalrights/images/godboldo.jpg">Nevertheless, the state took Ariana from her home and put her in a pediatric psychiatric hospital–just to keep her on the drug. State doctors, ironically, would take Ariana off the drug just a few weeks later, in essence agreeing with Maryanne’s original “unacceptable” decision. Yet, Ariana was not returned to her mother for several weeks, during which time Godboldo faced multiple criminal charges as well as the neglect charges in family court.</p>
<p>
<em>[Photo of Maryanne Godboldo on the steps curtesy of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/Jstice4Maryanne/photos/?tab=album&amp;album_id=178678672179603" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@Jstice4Maryanne]</a>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>So began a six-year ordeal in court. </strong>
</span>A district court judge found that there was no probable cause to pursue the charges, but the local prosecutor appealed the decision no fewer than five times. Charges were still pending on appeal until January of this year, when Godboldo’s health made it clear she would never be able to stand trial.</p>
<p>Godboldo had suffered a brain aneurism in June of last year, and never recovered.</p>
<p>
<i>The Detroit Times</i> quotes Godboldo’s attorney, Byron Pitts: “It’s just a tragedy…the death of an innocent woman.”</p>
<p>
<img src="https://secure.parentalrights.org/neon/resource/parentalrights/images/Folmar_sm.jpg">Godboldo’s case also brought ParentalRights.org into contact with <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>Maryanne’s lead defense attorney, Allison Folmar, who is now a member of our Board of Directors. </strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>[Pictured right: Allison Folmar]</p>
<p>“Maryanne was an amazing mother who refused to accept the State’s flawed destiny for her only child. She protected Ariana as any mother would. She was an example to us all,” Folmar told ParentalRights.org. “She was loved and admired throughout the country, and we will all miss her terribly.”</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>We know of no better way to honor Maryanne’s legacy than by continuing</strong>
</span> <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>the work </strong>
</span>of protecting children by empowering parents to stand up for them. As Maryanne stood up for Ariana’s health and care, let us continue to stand for children all over the country by empowering those who know them best to make those vital choices<span style="font-family: Symbol;">—</span>their parents.</p>
<p>On April 28, 2018, the “Maryanne Godboldo Parental Rights Forum” will be held as a tribute to the work that Maryanne has done.</p>
<p>Thank you for standing with us!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Last month many of you reached out to your U.S. Senators while they were home for the August Recess and encouraged them to cosponsor the Parental Rights Amendment, <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-joint-resolution/48/text" target="_blank" rel="noopener">S.J. Res. 48</a>, led by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC). <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>Since they got back to Washington earlier this month, though, some of them seem to have forgotten all about it in the flood of other matters.</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>At least that’s what we might conclude from the fact that no additional senators have signed on to the measure since Congress returned after Labor Day.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>So now it’s time to remind them to get on board.</strong>
</span>
</p>

<p>
<b>Contact Your Senators About Parental Rights</b>
</p>
<p>
<strong>– Use the Advocacy Site</strong> – Our friends over at Home School Legal Defense Association have put together a letter urging your lawmakers to join this vital cause. If you are already part of their activist network or are a homeschooler wanting to register with them, you can access their letter and quickly send it to your lawmakers <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="http://advocacy.hslda.org/composeletters.aspx?AlertID=18" target="_blank" rel="noopener">through their advocacy site</a>.</p>
<p>
<em>
<strong>OR</strong>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>– Simply cut, paste, and edit (optional) the following and <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/map" target="_blank" rel="noopener">email it to your senators</a>
</strong> to urge them to sign on. We are asking that they contact Sen. Graham’s office and ask to become a cosponsor of S.J. Res. 48.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Dear Senator:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">I am heart-broken by the case of Charlie Gard, the critically-ill 10 month old child in the United Kingdom who died this summer. English and European Courts refused to let his parents bring him overseas for medical care citing “the best interests of the child” standard.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">I believe that the Parental Rights Amendment to the US Constitution (S.J. Res. 48) would ensure that such a horrific decision would never happen here in the United States. I urge you to support the Parental Rights Amendment to the Constitution to ensure that loving parents are legally protected in their ability to nurture, raise, and care for their minor children.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">The Parental Rights Amendment has been introduced in previous Congresses, and has bipartisan support across the United States. Please support the Parental Rights Amendment to protect children and their families.</p>

<p>If you visited your senators last month, you might want to mention that in your correspondence with them as well.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>Thank you for reaching out again to let the Senate know parental rights are worth standing up for!</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<![CDATA[<p>It’s not a typo. <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>We are calling on volunteers and state lawmakers to become “resolutionaries” for parental rights.</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>What is a “resolutionary,” you ask? Well, as a revolutionary starts a revolution,<span style="color: #cc7700;"> <strong>we are looking for “resolutionaries” in each state to start a resolution</strong>
</span>
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">
<span style="line-height: 115%;">
<span style="font-family: Georgia;">—</span>
</span>
</span>a state resolution calling on Congress to adopt the Parental Rights Amendment, that is.</p>
<p>Between 2010 and 2013, six states passed such resolutions: South Dakota, Louisiana, Montana, Idaho, Florida, and Wyoming. And now that the Parental Rights Amendment is back in the U.S. Congress, it is time to work on these again.</p>
<p>While not legally binding, a state resolution can help draw attention to the Parental Rights Amendment. It is fitting for the States, who ultimately hold the power to ratify a constitutional amendment, to call on Congress to present an amendment to them for that very purpose.</p>
<p>To be clear, this is different than a “Convention of States” effort. We are not calling for a convention. Rather, <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>we are asking each state<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Georgia;">—</span>we are asking <em>your</em> state<span style="font-size: 12pt;">
<span style="line-height: 115%;">
<span style="font-family: Georgia;">—</span>
</span>
</span>to urge <em>Congress</em> to propose the Amendment </strong>
</span>(under the same process we have been pursuing all along) and send it to them to ratify.</p>
<p>Most state legislatures will start up again in January, and we’d like to hit the ground running. So if your state does not already have a resolution, and if a parental rights statute effort isn’t already in the works, <strong>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">we invite you to </span>
<a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://secure.parentalrights.org/np/viewDocument?orgId=parentalrights&amp;id=4028e4e55e7f2cd5015ea0da4b9000ae" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
<span style="color: #cc7700;">download our model resolution language</span>
</a>
<span style="color: #cc7700;"> and share it with your <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://www.facebook.com/townhall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">state lawmakers</a>
</span>
</strong> to see if one or more of them will take the lead in getting this done.</p>
<p>The higher the number of States that resolve to call for the Amendment, the more pressure Congress will feel to get it done. And you can be instrumental in adding your State’s voice to the growing list.</p>
<p>So why not <strong>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">take a moment today </span>
</strong>to <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://secure.parentalrights.org/np/viewDocument?orgId=parentalrights&amp;id=4028e4e55e7f2cd5015ea0da4b9000ae" target="_blank" rel="noopener">print out the model language</a>, make some phone calls to your <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://www.facebook.com/townhall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">state senator or state house representative</a>, and see what can be done in your state? (And while you’re on the phone, <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://parentalrights.org/states/contact-your-representatives/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">call your U.S. Senators and urge them to cosponsor S.J.Res. 48</a>, the Parental Rights Amendment!) The truth is, you never know what you can accomplish until you try!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;">
<em>Pictures used with permission from <a style="color: #5e5d5d;" href="https://www.facebook.com/cure4carrie/">Cure 4 Carrie</a>.</em>
</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">
<strong>Mother Gives Her Life for Her Child</strong>
</h2>
<p>No one wants to see a child suffer. Any one of us, given the choice, would save the life of even a random child we do not know. But as the price to save that life rises, fewer and fewer will make that sacrifice. It’s part of what makes parents so amazing: <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>for a parent, no price is ever too high.</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>That was certainly the case for Carrie DeKlyen, a mother in Michigan who <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>gave her life this week to save her precious daughter. </strong>
</span>For Carrie, the baby girl’s life was worth more than her own.</p>
<p>Now, this is not the kind of self-sacrifice story we’ve heard so often. This wasn’t a split-second heroic act in a moment of high peril. DeKylen’s was a conscious, deliberate decision, and she had months to look back on it, to live with it, to feel its weight. And still she chose in favor of her child.</p>
<p>Carrie DeKylen, age 37, learned she was pregnant in April—just two weeks after she was diagnosed with glioblastoma, a highly invasive form of brain cancer. She underwent surgeries to remove a tumor, but chose with her husband to forego chemotherapy that might have saved her life but would have killed her unborn child, the couple’s sixth.</p>
<p>“It’s painful,” husband Nick told a reporter for an <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/09/09/woman-with-brain-cancer-who-chose-baby-instead-chemotherapy-has-died.html">article on Fox News.</a> “But this is what she wanted. She wanted to protect this child.”</p>
<p>Carrie slipped into a coma in July, but continued to carry the unborn child. Life Lynn was born by emergency C-section on September 6, weighing 1 pound, 4 ounces.  (She is in the Neo-natal Intensive Care, but doing well and expected to be a healthy child.)</p>
<p>Carrie passed away three days later.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #1c8296;">
<strong>“Experts” or Parents?</strong>
</span>
<br>
Amazingly, there are those who believe “experts” should have more say in a child’s life than the parent does. The doctors should make the medical decisions, the schools should make the education decisions, and the state should decide all the rest. But these people have apparently never met a parent like DeKylen.</p>
<p>The U.S. Supreme Court in 1979 put it like this: “natural bonds of affection lead parents to act in the best interest of their child.” Which is exactly why <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>parents, not doctors or school administrators or child service workers, are the best able to make decisions for that child.</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>The proposed <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://parentalrights.org/amendment/">Parental Rights Amendment</a> to the U.S. Constitution (S.J. Res. 48 in the U.S. Senate) recognizes this unparalleled role of parents by preserving their “liberty to direct the upbringing, education, and care of their child [as] a fundamental right.”</p>
<p>Most of us will never be put in a spot to know with certainty whether we would make the hard choices the DeKylens did. But we make similar, though smaller, choices every day.</p>
<p>We sacrifice what we have earned to secure what our children need. We set aside our own happiness for theirs, only to find it again in their laughter and smiles.</p>
<p>And so many of us make tough choices every day—those whose children have special needs or chronic illness or other extenuating circumstances. And that’s to say nothing of the single mom or dad working two jobs to put food on the table and have a little something extra for Christmas and birthdays.</p>
<p>Being a parent is not for the faint of heart. But with that weight comes the necessary right to make the choices that are best for your child. A government agent may want to claim that power, but will they pay the price you will for getting it wrong?</p>
<p>No one has more incentive to make the right choice for a child than the one who would literally lay her life down for that child’s well-being.</p>
<p>We know a lot of your donation dollars this month are going to help those affected by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, or the wildfires in the north and west. Our thoughts and prayers are with all of these as well.</p>
<p>Even so, <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>we thank you for continuing to stand with us to protect the right of parents</strong>
</span> to make the best decisions for their child.</p>

<p>
<strong>Capitol Hill Update: </strong>Our efforts to add cosponsors to <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-joint-resolution/48">S.J. Res. 48</a> in the Senate continue. Last week we met with the staff of Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA), who contributed a great deal to our understanding of what we can do to better reach his side of the aisle. Our effort in the House has been held up while we take some of those steps, but we continue to appreciate the full support and cooperation of our lead Congressional sponsor. You might want to <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://parentalrights.org/states/contact-your-representatives/">contact your senator again</a> and ask him to support S.J. Res. 48. And stay tuned for further updates.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>September means back to school, and for millions of American parents <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>that means a significant reduction in your parental rights.</strong>
</span>
</p>
<ul>
<li>In 1995 the First Circuit Court of Appeals held that “once parents make the choice as to which school their children will attend, <span style="color: #1c8296;">
<em>
<strong>their fundamental right to control the education of their children is, at the least, substantially diminished.</strong>
</em>”</span> <em>Brown v. Hot, Sexy, and Safer</em>, 68 F.3d 525 (1995) [emphasis added]</li>
<li>In 2005, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals went even further. In its <em>Fields v. Palmdale</em> decision the court notoriously “affirm[ed] that the <em>Meyer-Pierce </em>right [that is, <span style="color: #1c8296;">
<em>
<strong>your fundamental parental right] does not extend beyond the threshold of the school door.</strong>
</em>”</span> 427 F.3d 1197 (2005) [emphasis added]The decision met with such fierce public outcry that the U.S. Congress overwhelmingly passed a bipartisan resolution calling for its reversal. As a result, the court agreed to rehear the case <em>en banc</em>, and edited out the offending language. The result, however, remained the same: parents “have no constitutional right to prevent a public school from providing its students with whatever information it wishes to provide, sexual or otherwise, when and as the school determines that it is appropriate to do so.” (ibid.)</li>
</ul>
<p>[If you haven’t yet, check out and share these <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://parentalrights.org/understand_the_issue/current-state-parental-rights/parental-rights-public-school-access/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stories of parental rights and education</a>.]</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>The idea that you lose the right to oversee your child’s upbringing the moment they walk onto campus is one that doesn’t sit well with most parents. </strong>
</span>But it is arguably the law in the United States. Especially for those parents who feel they have no choice but public education—and no choice within public education except the school closest to their home—this is a bitter pill to swallow; it means they have no control at all.</p>
<p>This is one reason the proposed Parental Rights Amendment would declare in the text of the Constitution that “[t]he liberty of parents to direct the upbringing, education, and care of their children is a fundamental right.” This will not allow a parent to dictate what is taught to everyone else’s child, but it will put parents on much stronger footing in protecting their own child and guiding his or her education and development.</p>
<p>There are many wonderful teachers in our nation’s schools—including our public schools. But most of those exceptional teachers will tell you the same thing I will: that generally it is the parents who know their child the best, and not the school.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">The </span>
<a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://parentalrights.org/amendment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
<span style="color: #cc7700;">Parental Rights Amendment </span>
</a>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">is a major step to making sure loving parents stay in the driver’s seat of their child’s education.</span>
</strong>
</p>
<p>Thank you for standing with us as we continue to promote this vital effort in Congress. And thank you to those of you able to <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://secure.parentalrights.org/np/clients/parentalrights/donation.jsp?campaign=5&amp;=&amp;utm_source=website&amp;utm_campaign=backtoschool" target="_blank" rel="noopener">donate</a> to this important cause.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Lately we’ve been sharing a lot about what we’re doing in Washington and what we’re urging you to do in your state or district to <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://parentalrights.org/visit-senators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promote the Parental Rights Amendment</a>. Apart from the tragedy of <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://parentalrights.org/tag/charlie-gard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Charlie Gard</a>, though, there hasn’t been much time to talk about the “why” of it all.</p>
<p>You have heard the news. You’ve seen the horror stories. They are reasons you signed up with us in the first place.</p>
<p>But this week an opinion piece in a national publication once again put a finger on the pulse of a big part of what is wrong in America today. And it’s a problem we can help fix.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #1c8296;">
<strong>Poverty a Crime?</strong>
</span>
<br>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>In her <em>New York Times </em>article <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/22/opinion/poor-neighborhoods-black-parents-child-services.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">“Live in a Poor Neighborhood? Better Be a Perfect Parent,”</span>
</a> </strong>
</span>Emma S. Ketteringham painted a poignant and tragic picture of what it is to be in poverty and constantly at risk of losing your children as a result. It’s not that they are not imperfect parents, but that most of them are no more imperfect than the rest of us.</p>
<p>“A parent in Park Slope, where I live, can deal with depression or anxiety privately. A parent in the South Bronx cannot,” Ketteringham writes. “A parent in Park Slope can smoke marijuana or lose her temper and still be considered a good parent. A parent in the South Bronx would lose her kids for months, if not years, and have to go to drug-treatment and parenting classes to get custody back.”</p>
<p>This is not to say white parents or affluent parents of any hue don’t also see their parental rights threatened every day. Ketteringham is pointing out just one piece of the broader “parental rights” issue. In her words, “parents of color in the Bronx are held to a standard that few white parents in more privileged neighborhoods are expected to meet.”</p>
<p>Our own research shows that this experience, while closely linked to a certain demographic, is not unique to the South Bronx. In Michigan, for instance, more than 90% of all child welfare cases cite “neglect” as one of the factors leading to child removal. And a greatly disproportional number of those cases are in low-income minority homes. <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>As in the Bronx, the state has effectively made it a crime to be poor, and the punishment is the loss of your family.</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #1c8296;">
<strong>We Need the Parental Rights Amendment</strong>
</span>
<br>
You don’t need a Ph.D. to know there is something inherently wrong with a system that routinely destroys the families of the poor while finding “grace” for the wealthy. But what is to be done about it?</p>
<p>For starters, the Parental Rights Amendment would establish and protect as fundamental the liberty of parents to direct the upbringing and education of their children. <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>And that means <em>all</em> parents—rich parents, poor parents,</strong>
</span> white parents, black parents, Hispanic, Asian, or any other kind of parents. It means parents from Silicone Valley to the South Bronx. (To be clear, we do <em>not</em> mean abusive or truly negligent parents; no one has a right to abuse a child.)</p>
<p>The Amendment would also prohibit government at any level from harming these rights without showing a compelling governmental interest as applied to the person. This would effectively preserve (or, in some places, restore) the rebuttable presumption that fit parents act in the best interest of their children. (This “rebuttable presumption” is the family court equivalent of “innocent until proven guilty.”)</p>
<p>
<strong>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">Whether you’re a poor, black, single mom in the South Bronx working two jobs to keep the lights on, or a </span>
<a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://parentalrights.org/tag/charlie-gard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
<span style="color: #cc7700;">middle-class white British family</span>
</a>
</strong> with $1.7 million in donations to help your dying son, you know nothing is more important than the liberty to take care of your child as only you know how.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>We are all parents first. </strong>
</span>The Parental Rights Amendment’s protection of parental rights will go a long way to removing bias and inequality from the way the system operates—because investigators and judges will no longer have the latitude to call parents “negligent” if they have no proof to back it up.</p>
<p>And after all, isn’t that as it should be?</p>
<p>This is why we are standing together to promote the Parental Rights Amendment.</p>

<li>If you haven’t already <span style="color: #cc7700;">

</span> and urge them to <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://parentalrights.org/get_involved/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sign up</a> as well. We’ll be reaching out to Congress as early as next month, so it would be powerful if they could <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://parentalrights.org/get_involved/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">add their voices to ours.</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Together—regardless of skin color, zip code, tax bracket, or beliefs—we can defend the rights of all fit parents in America to make the best decisions for their children.

<strong>Visit Your Senators before Labor Day While They’re Still Home on Summer Recess</strong>
</span>
</span>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<em>Pictured: PRO’s President, Jim Mason, in Indiana with local supporters after visiting with Senator Joe Donnelly’s (D-IN) case manager about the Parental Rights Amendment</em>
</p>
<p>Dear Champion of Parental Rights,</p>
<p>In case you missed the big news, Senator Lindsey Graham introduced the Parental Rights Amendment (Senate Joint Resolution 48 , or <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-joint-resolution/48/cosponsors?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22sjres+48%22%5D%7D&amp;r=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">S.J. Res. 48</a>) on August 1. Senators Blunt (R-MO), Grassley (R-IA), Isakson (R-GA), Risch (R-ID), and Rubio (R-FL) are original cosponsors.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>So now is the time to contact your senators and ask to meet with them about this issue. </strong>
</span>And since August is the summer recess, you will be able to find your lawmakers in your home state rather than having to settle for a phone call or travel to Washington, D.C., to see them.</p>

<p>
<strong>How to Visit Your Senators</strong>
<br>
To help you out, we have just posted a <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://parentalrights.org/how-to-visit-your-congressman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">step-by-step visit guide on our website.</a> In case you’re in a hurry, I’ll give you a brief run-down right here:</p>
<ol style="font-weight: bold;">
<li>Set up the meeting.<span style="font-weight: normal;"> Arrange for friends and family to join you if possible, then make the call and get on your senator’s schedule.</span>
</li>
<li>Prepare. <span style="font-weight: normal;">Choose one or two key points you want to make about parental rights (and if there are two or three of you ready to talk, you can each make different points). You can also find some helpful material on our <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="http://parentalrights.org/get_involved/print-resources=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Printable Resources</a> page.</span>
</li>
<li>Show up.<span style="font-weight: normal;"> Be on time, be patient, and be polite.</span>
</li>
<li>Make your presentation. <span style="font-weight: normal;">Parental rights are supported by the vast majority of Americans across the political spectrum, so you shouldn’t have trouble finding common ground and being heard. If they have questions you can’t answer, let them know you will find out and get back to them.</span>
</li>
<li>Follow up. <span style="font-weight: normal;">Start with a “thank you” note, but also get those answers you promised them. We’d be happy to help.</span>
</li>
<li>Let us know. <span style="font-weight: normal;">You don’t owe us a full report, but we’d love to hear how it went and how we can follow up with your senators when they return to D.C. Just email <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="mailto:info@parentalrights.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">info@parentalrights.org.</a>
</span>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Want more details? Read the more detailed <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://parentalrights.org/how-to-visit-your-congressman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">visiting guide</a>.</p>

<p>When we visited congressmen last month on Capitol Hill, the most promising thing we heard from any of them was, “We know this is an important issue, because we have been getting calls about it from our constituents.”<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong> We knew then they would listen to us <em>because they had heard from you.</em>
</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>Right now is your chance to make the same thing happen in the Senate. So please, take the time to make sure your senators hear from you this month, while they are available in your state.</p>
<p>Together, we can see S.J. Res. 48, the Parental Rights Amendment, become a reality!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<em>Pictured: PRO’s President, Jim Mason, in Michigan with PRO Board Members Pastor Marvin L. Winans, Sr., and Allison Folmar</em>
</p>
<p>Dear Champion of Parental Rights,</p>
<p>It’s not every day that my quest to raise bipartisan support for parental rights brings me face to face with a gospel music legend.</p>
<p>But there I was last Wednesday, <strong>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">attending a town hall meeting near Detroit and finally shaking hands with </span>
<a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://parentalrights.org/about#winans" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
<span style="color: #cc7700;">ParentalRights.org board member Marvin L. Winans</span>
</a>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">.</span> </strong>Though we’ve been on the same team for some time, until now I hadn’t met him in person.</p>
<p>I flew to the Motor City in hopes of talking to <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://lawrence.house.gov/">U.S. Rep. Brenda Lawrence</a> about being a co-sponsor of the Parental Rights Amendment <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>expected to be introduced soon in the House.</strong>
</span> It’s meant to complement <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-joint-resolution/48" target="_blank" rel="noopener">S.J. Res. 48</a>, recently <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://parentalrights.org/prasintro17/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduced in the Senate</a>.</p>
<p>Both measures aim to amend the Constitution so that it explicitly recognizes the fundamental right of parents to direct the upbringing and education of their children.</p>
<p>Because the effort is so crucial, and because it takes a two-thirds majority in both houses of Congress to get proposed amendments sent on to the states, <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>we’re trying hard to build a coalition that spans both sides of the political aisle.</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>With her commitment to family and background as a former mayor and board of education member, Rep. Lawrence would prove an excellent advocate.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I had been unable to connect with her in Washington. Which is why I found myself at the Sahara Restaurant and Grill in Oak Park, Michigan, as part of a delegation including Pastor Winans and Allison Folmar, a civil rights attorney who is also on the board of ParentalRights.org, and is a constituent (and friend) of Congresswoman Lawrence.</p>
<p>Rep. Lawrence was there addressing her constituents, but couldn’t help taking time to welcome Marvin as a visiting dignitary. Which is understandable considering that, among other things, Marvin’s accomplishments include pastoring a major local church, founding a school for the performing arts—oh, and winning a Grammy.</p>
<p>We only got a quick introduction to Congresswoman Lawrence but were able to speak longer with her district manager.</p>
<p>
<a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://parentalrights.org/winans-video/">
<img src="https://secure.parentalrights.org/neon/resource/parentalrights/images/SmallerImages/video.jpg">
</a>Outside the restaurant, Pastor Winans <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://parentalrights.org/winans-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recorded a quick video telling why he supports the Parental Rights Amendment</a>.</p>
<p>“There are things that are dear to me that I must impart to my sons, my grandchildren, and I don’t need the government telling me what I can and cannot say,” he said. “It’s very important [we] get on this bill…to make sure parents have the God-given right to raise their children.”</p>
<p>We hope to arrange a sit-down meeting with Congresswoman Lawrence before Labor Day during the congressional recess, and we encourage you to gather some friends and arrange a similar meeting to discuss S.J. Res. 48 with your Senators. (We’ll send more details on meeting with your Senators next week, and we expect to encourage you to reach out to your representatives in September; stay tuned!)</p>
<p>In preparation for our next push, <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>please share Bishop Winans’ video with your family and friends</strong> </span>and urge them to <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://parentalrights.org/winans-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sign up for updates at ParentalRights.org</a>. Urge them to take this vital stand with us. And if you haven’t yet, take a moment to <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://parentalrights.org/contact-senators" target="_blank" rel="noopener">call your Senators and ask them to support S.J. Res. 48.</a>
</p>
<p>Then, raising our voices together we can make our message heard and see the Parental Rights Amendment advance!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
<span style="color: #1c8296;">
<span style="font-size: 20px;">
<strong>Ask Your Two U.S. Senators to Cosponsor the Parental Rights Amendment!</strong>
</span>
</span>
</p>
<p>Now that the Parental Rights Amendment to the U.S. Constitution has been <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://parentalrights.org/prasintro17/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reintroduced in the U.S. Senate</a>, we need your help to add cosponsors. Will you stand with us to protect children and families and ensure that no family in our nation ever goes through what <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://parentalrights.org/learning-from-charlie-gard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Charlie Gard and his parents had to suffer in the U.K.</a>?</p>
<p>Here are three ways that you can help pass the Parental Rights Amendment:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Call your two U.S. Senators</strong> at the Capitol Switch Board, 202-224-3121, and ask your senators to cosponsor the Parental Rights Amendment. Your message can be as simple as “Thank you for taking my call today. I urge the Senator to cosponsor <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-joint-resolution/48/cosponsors?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22sjres+48%22%5D%7D&amp;r=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">S.J.Res. 48</a>, Senator Lindsey Graham’s Parental Rights Amendment. This Amendment will ensure that loving parents are able to raise, educate, and nurture their own children, free from government control or restrictions.” If you do not know who your two U.S. Senators are, you can find out <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/map" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</li>
<li>If you have additional time, visit <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="http://www.senate.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.senate.gov</a> and use the “Find Your Senators” link in the upper left corner by the American flag and follow the “Contact” links to <strong>send an email </strong>with the same wording (or add in an additional message explaining why protecting parental rights is important to you).</li>
<li>And if you have the time to <strong>meet with your senators or their staff during the August recess</strong>, then we encourage you to call their office (either in Washington, D.C., using the number above, or by calling a district office) and ask to set up a meeting before Labor Day. This can be a great opportunity to take your children and other families with you to meet your elected officials and ask them to support the Parental Rights Amendment. (Next week, we will be sending a step-by-step guide to make your visit a success.)</li>
</ol>
<p>We have numerous resources to help you learn more about the <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://parentalrights.org/amendment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Parental Rights Amendment</a>. We are grateful to already have the support of Senator Lindsey Graham (SC), who introduced the Parental Rights Amendment, and Senators Marco Rubio (FL), Roy Blunt (MO), Jim Risch (ID), Chuck Grassley (IA), and Johnny Isakson (GA) who have signed on as original cosponsors.</p>
<p>Thank you for standing with us to protect the fundamental right of parents—not government bureaucrats—to raise their own children.</p>
<p>For Liberty,</p>

</p>
<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE // August 1, 2017 // Washington, D.C. – Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) has introduced legislation in the U.S. Senate to propose a Parental Rights Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Graham’s Senate Joint Resolution 48 had four original cosponsors at its introduction on Tuesday, August 1: Roy Blunt (R-MO), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Johnny Isakson (R-GA), and Jim Risch (R-ID).</p>
<p>“We are gratified to see this crucial amendment introduced in the U.S. Senate for the fifth straight Congress,” declared <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="http://ParentalRights.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ParentalRights.org</a> President Jim Mason, a proponent of the resolution. <strong>“If the recent Charlie Gard tragedy in the UK showed us anything it is that children are better served when loving parents make the important decisions about their care.”</strong>
</p>
<p>The Amendment, which would provide that “[t]he liberty of parents to direct the upbringing, education, and care of their children is a fundamental right,” requires a two-thirds vote in each house of Congress to go to the states for ratification. This means bipartisan support will be necessary for its passage.</p>
<p>“The Parental Rights Amendment should absolutely have bipartisan support,” according to Detroit-area family law attorney Allison Folmar. “And the consensus among the American people is that it does have that support. <strong>Now we’re looking to Congress to reflect that reality.”</strong>
</p>
<p>The NFL’s 2005 MVP, Shaun Alexander, is also among those supporting the Amendment effort. Alexander is vice-president of ParentalRights.org.</p>
<p>“The Parental Rights Amendment will protect the greatest team ever assembled—the family. Let’s pass this amendment and let’s protect the family,” Alexander said in a recent release to the organization. “I want to thank South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham for his leadership in introducing this amendment, and I want to thank Senators Risch, Blunt, and Isakson [Grassley and Rubio were added after this statement] for standing up for parents and children across this great nation as original cosponsors of the Parental Rights Amendment.”</p>
<p>Senators interested in cosponsoring S. J. Res. 48 measure should contact Senator Graham’s office.</p>
<p>
<em>[August 2 Update: Marco Rubio (R-FL) was added as an original cosponsor as well, meaning there were five original cosponsors, along with sponsor Senator Graham.]</em>

<strong>We Need Your Help!</strong>

</p>
<p>Now that the Amendment is again in motion in the U.S. Senate, <strong>we really need your support to keep the effort moving forward. </strong>

<strong>Parental Rights Matter to Us All</strong>
</span>
</span>
</p>
<p>An 11-month-old, severely ill baby in the United Kingdom has become the talk of the world. Charlie Gard, sick with infantile onset encephalomyopathy mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome (MDDS) and with little chance of recovery, is all over the news and the internet.</p>
<p>
<strong>The issue at hand is whether Charlie’s parents or his government should decide when it is time to remove the child from life support.</strong> Under British and European law, when doctors and parents disagree, a judge makes the final call. And, not surprisingly, the judge is not as intent as Charlie’s parents are on taking every available option before they pull the plug.</p>
<p>(In late breaking news as seen is this <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/24/world/europe/uk-charlie-gard-parents.html">
<em>New York Times</em> article</a>, Charlie’s parents today withdrew their legal appeal, ending their effort of prolonging the boy’s life.)</p>
<p>The case has been covered by everyone from the <em>
<a style="color: #cc7700;" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/charlie-gard-mitochondrial-disease-suffers-legal-battle/">Telegraph</a>
</em> to <em>
<a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2017/07/24/charlie-gard-legal-battle-enters-final-phase/503848001/">USA Today</a>
</em>, with parents everywhere fueling the outcry. Charles Krauthammer in the <em>
<a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/what-to-do-for-little-charlie-gard/2017/07/20/6e7916d2-6d65-11e7-96ab-5f38140b38cc_story.html?utm_term=.4d44e8f1862f">Washington Post</a> </em>essentially wrote, “I disagree with the parents’ decision to prolong his life, but I wholeheartedly agree it is their decision to make.” And in a case like this where there are no easy answers, that’s just as it should be.</p>
<p>So what are we learning from all of this?</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<span style="font-size: 24px;">
<b>The Numbers Haven’t Changed.</b> </span>
</span>
<br>
<img src="https://secure.parentalrights.org/neon/resource/parentalrights/images/WideTopImages/family.png">
<br>
In 2010 a Zogby poll showed that <strong>more than 93% of all Americans agree</strong> that, absent evidence of abuse or neglect, parents have the right to make important decisions for their children. We don’t have an updated poll, but if the furor over Charlie Gard tells us anything, it is that the high level of support for parental rights hasn’t gone anywhere.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<span style="font-size: 24px;">
<b>We Are United.</b> </span>
</span>
<br>
<img src="https://secure.parentalrights.org/neon/resource/parentalrights/images/WideTopImages/united1.png">
<br>
In that poll, <strong>more than 91% of Democrats, more than 93% of independents, and an amazing 97% of conservatives agreed with parental rights.</strong> As we look at the news media and opinion pieces about Charlie Gard all these years later, we are still seeing that same general divide—which is to say, almost none at all. There was disagreement over whether or not Charlie’s parents were making the right call—witness the <em>Washington Post</em> article mentioned above – but we almost all agree it must be their call to make.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<span style="font-size: 24px;">
<b>We Don’t Want Charlie’s Situation Here.</b> </span>
</span>
<br>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<span style="font-size: 24px;">
<b>
<img src="https://secure.parentalrights.org/neon/resource/parentalrights/images/SmallerImages/no.png">
</b>
</span>
</span>Charlie himself we would welcome with open arms, along with his parents. Congress even passed a special bill last week to grant him permanent residence in the U.S. so that, in the event the Greater Ormond Street Hospital and the British judge let him leave London, he could come here for care with virtually no red tape on our end.</p>
<p>But the situation—judges deciding whether a severely ill child should live or die while fit and loving parents still cling to hope, however desperate—is not one we want to see on our shores. Multiple news articles have made the distinction between the European norm (the judge decides) and the U.S. standard (parents make that call).</p>
<p>In short, we are learning that <strong>we need the Parental Rights Amendment now more than ever. </strong>That’s because whatever takes hold in Europe, whether in legal, political, cultural, social, or even economic circles, has a tendency to make its way here eventually. And even now Charlie’s case is stirring elites in America to say, “We disagree with the parents’ (original) decision, so let’s give the choice to someone else instead.”</p>
<p>Already in America, some parents don’t even get that far. A couple <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="http://www.oregonlive.com/pacific-northwest-news/index.ssf/2017/07/parents_with_intellectual_disa.html">in Oregon this month</a> lost their second child to the state before they could even make it home from the hospital. They were not charged with abuse or accused of neglect. But because both parents are intellectually challenged, the state concluded – with no respect for the support network the young parents have in place—that they were simply incapable of raising a child. Already, judges are overruling parents because someone disagrees.</p>
<p>
<strong>Clearly, we will not avoid this danger by doing nothing.</strong>
</p>
<p>Only the Parental Rights Amendment can guarantee the liberty of parents to make the hard decisions for their children. Only the PRA can protect the once-sacred Supreme Court standard that parents enjoy a legal presumption that, absent evidence of abuse or neglect, “natural bonds of affection lead parents to act in the best interests of their children” [<em>
<span style="font-family: Georgia;">Parham v. J. R.</span>
</em>, 442 U.S. 584 (1979)]. And it will also protect these rights for those who might otherwise lose their children due to a disability.</p>
<p>And there’s good news right around the corner on Capitol Hill. Our visits earlier this month yielded some exciting news, and we’re just ironing out the details before we can pass it on to you.</p>
<p>But we cannot continue the work alone. We rely on supporters like you passing the word about parental rights and the proposed Amendment to their family and friends. With your help in <strong>forwarding this email and asking your loved ones to <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://parentalrights.org/get_involved/">sign up</a>, </strong>we can build a strong and vocal army to defend parental rights.</p>
<p>
<strong>Together we can keep what’s happening to Charlie from coming here—and correct those instances where it’s already taking place.</strong>
</p>
<p>Thank you for standing with us to protect these precious children by empowering their parents to make the best decisions for their lives.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>Our “Parental Rights on the Hill” day July 13 was a rousing success and resulted in excellent news for the Parental Rights Amendment (PRA)!</strong>
</span> We gathered our board members from all over the country for a meeting in D.C. and connected them with members of Congress while they were here.</p>
<p>We scheduled three kinds of meetings going in: friendly meetings with members of Congress we expect will cosponsor the PRA again this year, challenging meetings with members who have never sponsored before, and “business” meetings with leaders we thought might truly champion the Amendment.</p>
<p>In the process, <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>we secured some exciting news, </strong>
</span>but with the caveat that we need to sit on it for the next two or three weeks. When we can give you that report, though, we will all have exciting work to do!</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>Each member of our board in attendance got to meet with their own congressman</strong>
</span>
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Georgia; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US;">—</span>whether Ken Calvert (R-CA), Bob Johnson (R-OH), or Lou Barletta (R-PA). We also met with Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA), and stopped by the offices of Sens. Toomey (R-PA) and Portman (R-OH).</p>
<p>
<img src="https://secure.parentalrights.org/neon/resource/parentalrights/images/DCLobbyingDayRepJohnson.jpg">
</p>
<p>There was, however, one exception. Instead of visiting his own congresswoman, <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>former University of Alabama running back and ParentalRights.org board vice-president Shaun Alexander</strong>
</span> thrilled the offices of Sen. Strange (R-AL), Rep. Aderholt (R-AL), and Rep. Sewell (D-AL). (He has a pretty big fan in Rep. Steve King’s office as well!)</p>
<p>
<img src="https://secure.parentalrights.org/neon/resource/parentalrights/images/DCLobbying-Shaun.jpg">
</p>
<p>Then the board came together to visit Rep. Steve King (R-IA). <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>Rep. King was especially gracious, taking nearly a half hour out of an extremely busy day</strong>
</span> to sit down and talk with all of us personally about his support for parental rights.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://secure.parentalrights.org/neon/resource/parentalrights/images/DCLobbying-RepKing.jpg">
</p>
<p>The final meeting of the day wasn’t so much for lobbying, but more of a chance to begin coordinating some really big plans for the PRA.</p>
<p>The board had some opportunities during the day to touch base with each other, particularly over dinner. <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>Lunch was also a highlight, featuring an outstanding speaker (and new friend to ParentalRights.org), Dr. Pat Ware. </strong>
</span>Ware has held various human services-related positions in every administration since President Carter, and she is respected by members of both parties as an expert on child welfare and families in the inner cities.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://secure.parentalrights.org/neon/resource/parentalrights/images/DCLobbyingPat1.jpg">
</p>
<p>For our staff, the day began before 6:30 a.m. and didn’t wrap up until almost 9:00 p.m. It was long and exhausting, but it was well worth it!</p>
<p>
<img src="https://secure.parentalrights.org/neon/resource/parentalrights/images/DCLobbying-Long-Day1.jpg">
</p>
<p>Every meeting went well, and every board member reported having a fulfilling and productive day. Personally, I could not be happier with the outcomes!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<span style="color: #cc7700;">
<b>******This Success Is Yours******</b>
</span>
</p>
<p>Without your support, we could not have victories like this one, and we would never see the Amendment introduced, let alone passed. Some of the offices we visited Thursday specifically told us they have been hearing from their constituents—and we haven’t even held a call blitz!</p>
<p>If you haven’t given lately to sustain the effort, now would be the perfect time: <a style="color: #cc7700;" href="https://secure.parentalrights.org/np/clients/parentalrights/donation.jsp?campaign=5&amp;=&amp;utm_source=email">
<strong>your gift</strong>
</a> can offset the costs from Thursday and fuel an exciting drive that will get underway in the next few weeks!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<a href="https://secure.parentalrights.org/np/clients/parentalrights/donation.jsp?campaign=5&amp;=&amp;utm_source=email">
<img src="https://secure.parentalrights.org/neon/resource/parentalrights/images/donate-large(1).jpg">
</a>
</p>
<p>Whether you can give or not, we thank you for your ongoing support of this vital cause. We can’t do any of this without you. We are dependent on your donations, your grassroots support, your calls and emails to Congress, your sharing the issue with your friends, and even your prayers for our success.</p>
<p>For all of these, we thank you. <span style="color: #cc7700;">
<strong>The resounding success of last Thursday is one we share with you all!</strong>
</span>

</span>
</p>
<p>The United Kingdom’s highest court has determined it is in Charlie Gard’s “best interest” for his parents to give up on him and watch him die. The European Court of Human Rights tacitly agrees.</p>
<p>
<a style="color: #c67000;" href="http://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/charlie-gards-mom-terminally-ill-baby-suffering-48502007" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unless a last-minute rehearing reaches a different conclusion</a>, under European law this renders Charlie hopeless, his parents powerless to intervene.</p>
<p>His parents raised more than $1.6 million in private funds to transport Charlie to the U.S. for further care. But the state hospital has been granted the legal right to pull the plug on the disabled infant at any time.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #c67000;">
<strong>This is what happens when the state, not loving parents, decides what is best for a child: </strong>
</span>it miraculously happens to match whatever is best for the government!</p>
<p>Sadly, what happens in Europe has a way of coming here as well. And with the Supreme Court’s <i>Troxel v. Granville</i> (2000) decision, the way has already been paved.</p>
<p>Where once parental rights were afforded “strict judicial scrutiny” protection (<i>Troxel</i>, p. 80), now those same rights are granted only “some special weight” (<i>ibid</i>., p. 70)—and what that means varies from judge to judge and case to case.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #c67000;">
<strong>Only the Parental Rights Amendment can keep what is happening to Charlie and his parents from ever coming to our shores.</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>Whether or not we can <a style="color: #c67000;" href="http://citizengo.org/en/lf/71800-petition-save-charlie-gard-10-month-old-sentenced-death-london-hospital" target="_blank" rel="noopener">save Charlie</a>, we must stand up and say, “Never here. Never again.”</p>

<![CDATA[<p>All hope for 10-month-old Charlie Gard died when the European Court of Human Rights denied the petition to hear his parents’ appeal of a British court ruling that will end his life. Charlie has a rare genetic condition that has rendered him immobile and unable even to eat or breathe on his own, but an experimental treatment in the U.S. once gave his parents hope. State doctors sued for the power to end his life citing the child’s “best interests,” and the courts agreed. Now, their last chance of an appeal exhausted, <span style="color: #c67000;">
<strong>parents Chris Gard and Connie Yates are forced to watch their baby die.</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>“Natural bonds of affection lead parents to act in the best interests of their children,” the U.S. Supreme Court has held. <i>Parham v. J.R.</i>, 442 U.S. 584 (1979) But in Charlie’s case, the doctors and courts have decided that they know better.</p>
<p>There is much more to this <a style="color: #c67000;" href="http://www.nationalreview.com/article/449079/charlie-gard-united-kingdom-court-defies-parents-wishes-rare-disease-die" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heart-wrenching story</a>, and we will follow it closely and keep you updated. But the bottom line is this: parents, not doctors or courts, should be trusted to make the best decisions for their children (absent abuse or neglect).</p>
<p>Sadly, there is no action we can take as an organization that would save young Charlie’s life. But we can act to keep this kind of judicial overreach from coming to our country.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #c67000;">
<strong>Please take a moment right now to contact your federal representative and two federal senators </strong>
</span>and urge their support for the Parental Rights Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. This bi-partisan common-sense solution will keep parents in the driver’s seat when their child’s life is on the line – and during all the other ordinary decisions parents must make every day.</p>
<p>Our friends at Home School Legal Defense Association have graciously made their legislative toolbox available for our use to speed your response time, so <a style="color: #c67000;" href="http://preview.capitolconnect.com/advocacy.hslda/register.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">click here</a> to enter your info and contact your lawmakers with a personalized message. (This will not subscribe you to anything from HSLDA, but you will need to “register” to link you to the right officeholders. On the page after you register, click the red “Take Action” button near the top-right corner of the page to customize and send your message.)</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #c67000;">
<strong>Only by standing together can we prevent the kind of government-knows-best rulings infecting Europe from taking over American courts as well. </strong>
</span>Thank you for taking your stand with us to protect children today!<br>

<![CDATA[<p>The effort to pass a parental rights bill in Maine this year <strong>came up nine votes short in the House last Friday</strong> when <a style="color: #c67000;" href="http://legislature.maine.gov/LawMakerWeb/summary.asp?ID=280063180" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LD 472</a> failed by a vote of 68-76. Emails and phone calls in response to our alert last week closed the gap from an earlier vote, as Reps. Sherman (R-Hodgdon) and Stanley (D-Medway) were persuaded to change their votes in our favor.</p>
<p>While this ends the effort to secure parental rights in Maine in 2017, everyone involved in the effort remains excited about the chance to<strong> bring it back in 2018. </strong>Rep. Ellie Espling is still prepared to lead the charge, with the continuing support of ParentalRights.org and our allies at Homeschoolers of Maine and Home School Legal Defense Association. In addition, this year’s “failed” effort enabled us to identify some lawyers in the Senate whom we believe we can enlist to support the effort next year. We will also be able next year to avoid the wording and placement issues that forced us to work in an amendment this session.</p>
<p>So, while parental rights in Maine currently remain protected only by the courts – which is thin protection indeed! – we have great confidence that together we can change that in the coming year.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<![CDATA[<p>This week ParentalRights.org takes another step toward introducing the Parental Rights Amendment in the U.S. House. <strong>We are inviting organizations to sign a coalition letter in favor of the Amendment (PRA) to strengthen the pending introduction.</strong>
</p>
<p>A coalition letter is a means for organizations to show their support of an issue or a piece of legislation such as the PRA. In this case, ParentalRights.org has written a letter supporting the PRA and asked allied organizations to add their “signature” to the end of it. So far signers include such far-reaching organizations as the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation, Concerned Women for America, and Americans for Tax Reform, as well as key state organizations from Maine to Alabama and from Delaware to Montana.</p>
<p>If you are a president or owner of an organization and would like to sign on, please let me know at <a href="mailto:Michael@parentalrights.org">Michael@parentalrights.org</a>. If you have contact and influence with an organization you believe would be interested, please encourage them to get in touch with us, too; I’d be happy to answer any questions they may have.</p>
<p>Please note that we are not collecting individual signatures. The purpose of a coalition letter is to show that organizations (not individuals) have come together to back parental rights. So while your individual support is certainly appreciated – we literally would not exist as an organization without all of you! – <strong>this letter is for supporting <em>organizations</em>.</strong>
</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://secure.parentalrights.org/neon/resource/parentalrights/files/PRA%20Coalition%20House%202017.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">read the letter supporting parental rights</a>, and feel free to print out a copy for any other organizations who need to consider it.</p>
<p>Our last coalition letter garnered 77 signatures representing national, state, and local organizations. <strong>Our goal this week is to have 100 or more on this year’s letter.</strong>
</p>
<p>To be sure your organization is included in the first printing of the letter, <strong>we’ll need the signer’s name, title, and name of the organization by 4:00 Eastern on Friday, June 16. </strong>(Those who sign later will be added to a newer copy, but the letter with their signature may or may not reach all of the congressional offices that the first printing will reach.)</p>
<p>For those of you new to the introduction process, this letter is one of the final steps before we start securing initial cosponsors. <strong>Call blitzes and email campaigns are just around the corner. </strong>So hang on for an exciting summer!</p>
<p>And thank you as always for standing with us, individually and through organizations, to promote and protect parental rights.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Dear Parental Rights Champion in Maine,</p>
<p>
<strong>Parental Rights in Maine may now depend on you</strong>–the select few who live in the district of a potentially pivotal state representative.</p>
<p>On Thursday, June 8, the Maine House voted against the parental rights bill, <a href="http://legislature.maine.gov/LawMakerWeb/summary.asp?ID=280063180" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LD 472</a>, by a vote of 78-69 (3 absent, 1 excused). But the bill is still alive in the Senate.</p>
<p>If the Senate votes in favor of parental rights, which is likely, then LD 472 can <strong>go back to the House for one final chance to overturn last Thursday’s vote.</strong>
</p>
<p>The problem is, of course, that it’s still the same House that voted it down last week. So we need your help to reach out today to the potential swing votes.</p>
<p>
<strong>If your lawmaker is on this list, please email him today in support of LD 472:</strong>
</p>
<p>Rep. Ackley (C – Monmouth) – <a href="mailto:Kent.Ackley@legislature.maine.gov">Kent.Ackley@legislature.maine.gov</a>
</p>

</p>
<p>Rep. Stanley (D – Medway) – <a href="mailto:Stephen.Stanley@legislature.maine.gov">Stephen.Stanley@legislature.maine.gov</a>
</p>
<strong>ACTION NEEDED<br>
</strong>
<strong>If your lawmaker is on the list above, it is extremely important that you contact him today.</strong> Identify yourself by name <em>and address</em> (so they know you are from their district). Then, urge him to support parental rights by voting in favor of LD 472 as amended.Finally, pass this on to other supportive parents you know in your district and ask them to join you in speaking up.<p>
</p>
<p>We are all with you in this, but because many of us are outside the district, our voices will have no impact. <strong>We are counting on those of you in these districts to speak up for those of us who can’t.</strong> You must speak for all of us!</p>

<p>•••••••••••••••••••••••••<br>
<strong>BACKGROUND </strong>
<br>
<em>(from Attorney Scott Woodruff)</em>
</p>
<p>There are three types of citizen rights: absolute, fundamental, and ordinary. Each type gets a different type of protection. If a right is absolute, the government can’t touch it. If a right is ordinary, the government can put virtually any restriction on it.</p>
<p>Between these two extremes are fundamental rights. When a right is labeled as fundamental, the government can restrict it only if it meets three criteria. (1) The need for a restriction must be compelling. (2) The type of restriction must be narrowly focused to meet the need. (3) And the restriction must cause the least possible actual constraint on the citizen that is required to get the job done. In the language of the courts, these three used together are called “strict scrutiny”.</p>
<p>The right to decide how your children are reared has been considered a fundamental right since 1925, according to the U.S. Supreme Court. (It has never been considered absolute.)</p>
<p>But in 2000, something incredibly confusing happened. The U.S. Supreme Court issued a decision (<em>Troxel v. Granville</em>) which SAID parental rights were fundamental but stunningly the Court refused to come right out and say whether parental rights deserve the protection of strict scrutiny that all other fundamental rights receive.</p>
<p>With this deafening silence, many courts began assuming that the U.S. Constitution does not really require that a government restriction on parents pass the strict scrutiny test. Since then, more than 25 courts have refused to treat the rights of parents as deserving of strict scrutiny. In effect, those courts treated the rights of parents as if they had been downgraded to ordinary rights.</p>
<p>This “downgrading” has not happened in Maine courts–at least not yet. But as of today, there is absolutely nothing that would prevent a Maine judge from deciding to downgrade your right to rear your kids to an ordinary right and take away strict scrutiny protection. This would be a crushing blow to normal family relationships.</p>
<p>Think of how the government regulates welfare benefits, drivers licenses, banks and insurance companies–piles and piles of regulations! These regulations are rarely overturned because they restrict rights that are merely ordinary. That is how the government would be empowered to regulate parenting if parental rights are downgraded to ordinary.</p>
<p>How the U.S. Constitution is interpreted by judges will vary over time. But the U.S. Constitution is not the only source of citizen rights! State legislatures can–and often do–enact laws to protect rights. In fact, 10 states have decided to put parental rights on the books rather than let them toss in the wind with every new judicial decision.</p>
<p>Now it’s Maine’s turn. LD 472 is a simple, straightforward, uncomplicated solution. It puts into black and white that the rights of parents are fundamental and deserve the protection of strict scrutiny.</p>
<p>Because LD 472 merely puts into law what the Maine Supreme Court has already said (in <em>Rideout v. Riendeau</em>, for example), its enactment would actually cause no change whatsoever. Nor is it intended to cause change. It is intended to <em>prevent</em> a harmful change–the downgrading of parental rights in Maine to ordinary. It’s like a seatbelt–most of the time it makes no difference, but if you are in an accident, it could save you. LD 472 protects your right to raise your kids from the “accident” of a judge in Maine deciding it’s time to downgrade parental rights.</p>
<p>LD 472 gives parents no new rights. Parents won’t be able to do anything <em>after</em> its enactment that they could not do <em>before</em> its enactment. It won’t impact compulsory attendance laws, child labor laws, or child abuse-neglect laws because those all pass the strict scrutiny test, as universally recognized.</p>
<p>A technical note: the text of LD 472 that you will currently see on websites is not the final version. The sponsor has submitted an amendment to fully incorporate strict scrutiny protection.</p>
<p>For additional detail, I invite you to read <a href="https://secure.parentalrights.org/neon/resource/parentalrights/files/ME%20LD%20472%20Parental%20Rights%20Scott%27s%20Testimony.pdf">the written testimony I submitted to the committee on May 2</a>.</p>

<strong>THANK YOU!</strong>
</p>
<p>Thank you for standing up and speaking up for all parental rights champions in your state!</p>

<![CDATA[<p>In most states, the 2017 legislative session has finished up or is winding down. Eight state legislatures work year-round or at least for several more months, and five others are poised to adjourn unofficially in a few days (but officially are year-round, too). That leaves 37 states ready to head home for the summer.</p>
<p>Among these, <a href="http://www.parentalrights.org/wy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wyoming is the one bill passage victory</a> already achieved this session. (A victory in in Oklahoma and a partial victory in California have kept bad bills from being passed, at least so far.) As home to a brand new parental rights statute passed earlier this year, <strong>Wyoming brings to 10 the number of states protecting parental rights by state statute.</strong>
</p>
<p>But our year is not yet finished. Below are other legislative efforts in process.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<strong>New York Visitation Law</strong>
<br>
In New York, our effort to amend the grandparent visitation law is held up in committees as the legislature enters its final weeks. While we are certainly prepared to resume the work in the next session, we’d love to see it settled in this one. Find more about our <a href="http://www.parentalrights.org/ny_a7821a/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">effort in New York</a>.</p>
<p>
<strong>Maine – Awaiting Votes</strong>
<br>
In Maine, our effort to preserve parental rights in state law has cleared the committee with a “mixed report,” so we’re awaiting votes in both the House and Senate. If you need to know who to call or what to say (or just want to know more about that bill), you can check out our most recent <a href="http://www.parentalrights.org/me_ld472c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maine alert</a>. Like New York, Maine only has a few weeks left in their session.</p>
<p>
<strong>Pennsylvania – Active Parental Rights Bill</strong>
<br>
Among states with a year-round legislature, Pennsylvania has an active parental rights bill. With seven months left in the year, Rep. Tallman’s <a href="http://www.legis.state.pa.us/CFDOCS/Legis/PN/Public/btCheck.cfm?txtType=HTM&amp;sessYr=2017&amp;sessInd=0&amp;billBody=H&amp;billTyp=B&amp;billNbr=1349&amp;pn=1674" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HB 1349</a> still has time to work its way through the appropriate committees. While we don’t have a specific action item for the Keystone State at this time, you can contact your state representative any time and ask him or her to support Tallman’s bill. (You can <a href="http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/home/findyourlegislator/index.cfm?CFID=36864881&amp;CFTOKEN=13510674" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">find your Pennsylvania lawmaker here</a>.)</p>
<p>
<strong>Illinois – 2018 Efforts: Help Needed</strong>
<br>
As we look to get started on our 2018 efforts, we have a special need in Illinois. If you live in Illinois and have connections in the state legislature, we’d like to talk to you. Please email <a href="mailto:Michael@parentalrights.org?subject=Illinois%20Legislature">Michael@parentalrights.org</a> and put “Illinois Legislature” in the subject line for more information on how you can help.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>Thank you for standing with us</strong> as we work both state-by-state and at the federal level to protect your children by preserving <em>your</em> parental rights.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

</p>
Dear Champion of Parental Rights in Maine,
<p>I just received the following alert from Scott Woodruff, the attorney who spoke on our behalf before the Maine Judiciary Committee earlier this month. <strong>Please take note of his request and contact your lawmakers to support this bill.</strong>
</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>
<img src="http://www.parentalrights.org/vertical/Sites/%7BC49108C5-0630-467E-9B9B-B1FA31A72320%7D/uploads/Ramey-signature.png">

<p>—————-<br>
<em>
<img src="https://secure.parentalrights.org/neon/resource/parentalrights/images/Woodruff.jpeg">
</em>
<strong>Calls are urgently needed to urge Maine lawmakers to protect parental rights!</strong>
</p>
<p>Because the Joint Standing Committee on the Judiciary members did not agree on what to do with <a href="http://legislature.maine.gov/LawMakerWeb/summary.asp?ID=280063180" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LD 472</a> after their hearing and work session, the bill will go to the floor of both houses for debate and a vote.</p>
<p>Your state senator and representative need to hear from you—that you care about protecting the right of parents to raise their children!</p>
<p>The final vote could be very close. <strong>Your call or email could make the difference!</strong>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Action Requested</strong>
</p>
<p>Please send two emails: one to your state representative and one to your senator urging them to support LD 472. In the subject line, put, “Support LD 472.”</p>
<p>Then use your own words to convey your message. Using your own words (rather than a copy-and-paste message) will make your email personal and effective. Finally, list your street and city address so they know you live in their district.</p>
<p>To find out who your senator and representative are, <a href="https://openstates.org/find_your_legislator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">click here.</a>
</p>
<p>Keep in mind that a husband and wife are both voters—each should send an individual email!</p>
<p>Please pass this on to other parents you know!</p>

<p>
<strong>Background</strong>
</p>
<p>There are three types of citizen rights: absolute, fundamental, and ordinary. Each type gets a different type of protection. If a right is absolute, the government can’t touch it. If a right is ordinary, the government can put virtually any restriction on it.</p>
<p>Between these two extremes are fundamental rights. When a right is labeled as fundamental, the government can restrict it only if it meets three criteria: (1) The need for a restriction must be compelling. (2) The type of restriction must be narrowly focused to meet the need. (3) And the restriction must cause the least possible actual constraint on the citizen that is required to get the job done. In the language of the courts, these three used together are called “strict scrutiny.”</p>
<p>The right to decide how your children are reared has been considered a fundamental right since at least 1925, according to the U.S. Supreme Court. (It has never been considered absolute.)</p>
<p>But in 2000, something incredibly confusing happened. The U.S. Supreme Court issued a decision (<em>Troxel v. Granville</em>) which said parental rights were fundamental but, stunningly, the Court also refused to come right out and say whether parental rights deserve the protection of strict scrutiny that all other fundamental rights receive.</p>
<p>With this deafening silence, many courts began assuming that the U.S. Constitution does not really require that a government restriction on parents pass the strict scrutiny test. Since then, more than 25 courts have refused to treat the rights of parents as deserving of strict scrutiny. In effect, those courts treated the rights of parents as if they had been downgraded to ordinary rights.</p>
<p>This “downgrading” has not happened in Maine courts—at least not yet. But as of today, there is absolutely nothing that would prevent a Maine judge from deciding to downgrade your right to rear your kids to an ordinary right and take away strict scrutiny protection. This would be a crushing blow to normal family relationships.</p>
<p>Think of how the government regulates welfare benefits, driver’s licenses, banks and insurance companies—piles and piles of regulations! These regulations are rarely overturned because they restrict rights that are merely ordinary. That is how the government would be empowered to regulate parenting if parental rights are downgraded to ordinary.</p>
<p>Scotland recently treated parental rights as ordinary—and passed a law assigning a government agent to supervise every parent-child relationship.</p>
<p>How the U.S. Constitution is interpreted by judges will vary over time. But the U.S. Constitution, thankfully, is not the only source of citizen rights! State legislatures can—and often do—enact their own laws to protect rights. In fact, 10 states have decided to put parental rights on the books rather than let them toss in the wind with every new judicial decision.</p>
<p>Now it’s Maine’s turn. LD 472 is a simple, straightforward, uncomplicated solution. It puts into black and white that the rights of parents are fundamental and deserve the protection of strict scrutiny.</p>
<p>Because LD 472 merely puts into law what the Maine Supreme Court has already said (in <em>Rideout v. Riendeau</em>, for example), its enactment would actually cause no change whatsoever. Nor is it intended to cause change. It is intended to prevent a harmful change—the downgrading of parental rights in Maine to ordinary. It’s like a seatbelt—most of the time it makes no difference, but if you are in an accident, it could save you. LD 472 protects your right to raise your kids from the “accident” of a judge in Maine deciding it’s time to downgrade parental rights.</p>
<p>LD 472 gives parents no new rights. Parents won’t be able to do anything after its enactment that they could not before its enactment. It won’t impact compulsory school attendance laws, child labor laws, or child abuse-neglect laws because those all pass the strict scrutiny test, as is universally recognized.</p>
<p>(A technical note: the text of LD 472 that you will currently see on websites is not the final version. The sponsor is going to <a href="http://secure.parentalrights.org/neon/resource/parentalrights/files/Maine_proposal.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">amend it</a> to fully incorporate strict scrutiny protection.)</p>
<p>For additional detail, I invite you to read the <a href="https://secure.parentalrights.org/neon/resource/parentalrights/files/ME%20LD%20472%20Parental%20Rights%20Scott's%20Testimony.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">written testimony</a> I submitted to the committee on May 2.</p>
<p>Homeschoolers of Maine is united with HSLDA in supporting LD 472. Thank you for standing with us for freedom!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Scott Woodruff, Attorney<br>
(who spoke on behalf of ParentalRights.org at the May 2 hearing of the Maine Judiciary Committee)</p>

<strong>We need your help today to encourage the New York legislature to take a positive step for parental rights.</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>A7821, authored by Rep. Woerner (D- Round Lake) and the matching S6402 authored by Sen. Marchione (R- 43rd), constitute a rare and exciting opportunity to make gains for parental rights in New York.</p>
<p>These bills would make changes to New York’s grandparent visitation statute to ensure the presumption that parents make decisions in the best interests of their children, to limit the instances when grandparents or other third parties have standing to sue for visitation, and to provide for courts to require those who file suit under false pretenses to pay the court costs.</p>
<p>The legal presumption in favor of fit parents is in keeping with U.S. Supreme Court precedent from such cases as <em>Parham v. J.R.</em>, 442 U.S. 584 (1979), at 602: “The law’s concept of the family…historically…has recognized that natural bonds of affection lead parents to act in the best interests of their children.” This presumption is also in keeping with the overall aims of ParentalRights.org, including our efforts to establish the federal Parental Rights Amendment.</p>
<p>What’s more, <strong>making your voice heard on this issue is a very simple matter involving a few clicks and a couple minutes of your time.</strong>
</p>
<p>•••••••••••••••••••••••••<br>
<strong>ACTION REQUESTED</strong>
<br>
Here’s all you need to do to stand up for parental rights:</p>
<p>1. Visit the Senate bill page for S6402 here: <a style="color: darkred" href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2017/S6402" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2017/S6402</a>
</p>
<p>2. Find the blue “poll” box on the right side that asks, “Do you support this legislation?”</p>
<p>3. Click “Aye” and complete the brief survey. They’ll ask for your name, email, and home address to make sure your response gets to your lawmakers.</p>
<p>4. Then do the same for the Assembly bill page, also on the Senate site here: <a style="color: darkred" href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2017/a7821" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2017/a7821</a>
</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #800000">
<strong>5. Please pass this on to other parents you know!</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>•••••••••••••••••••••••••<br>
<strong>BACKGROUND</strong>
<br>
Fundamental parental rights start with what’s called a “rebuttable presumption” that parents act in the best interest of their child. A “rebuttable presumption” is a legal starting point; if the state cannot bring evidence to prove the notion false, the court must rule in favor of the parent. The concept of “innocent until proven guilty” is another rebuttable presumption. The person charged with a crime is innocent and the state must prove guilt; the defendant does not have to start “behind the 8 ball” and prove his innocence.</p>
<p>The first substantive edit A7821 would make is to put this presumption clearly into the grandparent visitation law.</p>
<p>The second edit removes an earlier presumption that if a spouse dies, his or her parents should necessarily have standing to sue for visitation. Such a presumption assumes the widow(er)’s parents and the remaining spouse cannot get along, or that grandparents will only sue in cases where a grieving spouse has cut them off without any valid reason. This is contrary to the presumption that this grieving parent, like any parent, is making decisions in the child’s best interest.</p>
<p>The edit still allows grandparents to sue for visitation in those circumstances where the remaining spouse is cutting off a thriving relationship to the detriment of the child. But it does not assume every grandparent who loses a child needs the court to intervene before they can visit with their grandchildren.</p>
<p>The third edit provides that those who file suit under this provision may be required to pay the court costs if their suit is shown to be frivolous.</p>
<p>
<strong>At least one family in New York today has been brought nearly to ruin through court costs</strong> in the effort to keep charge of their own children. Former in-laws, who know they have no case, have nonetheless brought the widowed spouse to court numerous times, knowing that sooner or later the family will not be able to afford to fight them off.</p>
<p>This third edit will prevent this kind of “war of attrition” by letting the court recognize that scenario and order the grandparents to pay <em>all</em> the court costs. This preserves in a very practical sense the ability of parents to defend their families long-term.</p>
<p>It should be noted that none of these edits will prevent good grandparents with a valid concern from still pursuing visitation under New York’s grandparent visitation law. But<strong> the changes will strengthen the position of good parents in cases where such protection is needed.</strong>
</p>
<p>Thank you for taking a moment right now to make your voice heard for parents and children in the Empire State.</p>

<strong>Movement in Maine – Main Supporters, Please Contact Lawmakers</strong>

<br>
For starters, our effort to pass parental rights legislation in Maine will face its final hurdles over the next several weeks. Supporters in the Pine Cone State are asked to contact your lawmakers and urge them to support Rep. Ellie Espling’s LD472. (If you haven’t already seen it, look for an update in the next couple of days with details and a link to find your Maine lawmakers – but if you already know how to contact them and what to say, there’s no need to wait; you can contact them today.)</p>

<strong>Working to Change Child Welfare Laws</strong>
</span>
<br>
Next, the bipartisan coalition we’ve been telling you about will be meeting with Congressional staffers next week to spell out needed changes to child welfare laws. Together with our friends across the political spectrum, we plan to show that existing laws encourage states to intrude in homes unnecessarily. Then, we’ll enlist champions to amend those laws to keep families together instead.</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #008000">
<strong>Drumroll…Reintroduction of the Parental Rights Amendment in Both Houses</strong>
</span>
<br>
As I mentioned at the top, though, the biggest event of the summer will be the reintroduction of the Parental Rights Amendment in both houses of Congress.</p>
<p>With new leadership, a new administration, and big projects like tax reform underway, Washington is somewhat challenging right now, which means even common causes like parental rights move slowly. But we have strong supporters on Capitol Hill who understand that you want to protect your children. We are coordinating with them now to bring the Parental Rights Amendment back to Congress and ultimately make it a reality.</p>
<p>Once we have all the exact dates and details ironed out<strong>, <span style="color: #008000">we will need your help to get as many initial cosponsors on board as possible. </span>
</strong>So watch for that coming call blitz.</p>
<p>In the meantime, hang on tight. We’re in for an exciting ride in the weeks ahead!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

</a>When 30-year-old <a href="http://www.fox29.com/news/241924681-story" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Danielle Janofsy</a> of New Jersey, who was 6 months pregnant, learned in February that she had metastasized melanoma, <strong>she opted right away to give life to her unborn son. </strong>He was born by C-section February 24<sup>th</sup>; Danielle died three days later.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://www.newsday.com/long-island/crime/cops-bethpage-mother-saves-daughter-from-kidnapper-s-clutches-1.13016157" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bethpage (New York) mother</a> who declined to be identified <strong>went to blows with a would-be kidnapper–twice–</strong>who tried to snatch her young daughter while both women visited the same tax services office. “Since she was acting crazy, I was going to act crazy with her,” the mother explained. If she hadn’t, “I probably would never have seen my daughter again.”</p>

</a>Then there’s Wyoming, Illinois, mother <a href="http://q13fox.com/2017/02/03/new-mom-dies-in-illinois-fire-but-saves-her-newborn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shelby Carter</a>, who was home alone with her newborn when a fire broke out in the house. Carter strapped her baby into a car seat and dropped her out a second story window before she herself succumbed to smoke inhalation. <strong>Her final act was to save her daughter’s life.</strong>
</p>
<p>Likewise, Colorado mother <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/colorado-mom-chelsey-russell-dies-saving-2-year-old-son-from-drowning-lake-powell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chelsey Russell</a> dove in and struggled for “five agonizing minutes” to keep her toddler’s head above water after he fell into Lake Powell last August. By the time relatives pulled them from the water, Chelsey was already unconscious; <strong>she saved her son, but she would never wake up.</strong>
</p>
<p>Chances are, you will never be put in the position to make this kind of bodily sacrifice for your children. But you know that if it came to it, you would do it in an instant.</p>
<p>It’s a simple truth: “Natural bonds of affection lead parents to act in the best interest of their children,” as the U.S. Supreme Court once acknowledged. And it so often makes the words “mom” and “hero” synonymous.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<strong>You may never have to shield your child from a tornado, but every day you seek to shield them from the storms of life around them. </strong>You won’t be cut open to give life as your own fades, but you know the cutting heartache of seeing your children struggle to learn and grow. If someone messes with your child, you just might “act crazy with them” a little bit, too. And only you know the struggle it is to keep your family afloat day after day.</p>
<p>This is what it is to be a parent: to care more about your child than you do about yourself.</p>
<p>So it is fitting as we approach Mothers’ Day that we stop to remember once again <em>all</em> the heroes who lay down their lives every day. I don’t just mean Ashlie Ovesny, Shelby Carter, or Chelsey Russell, though we honor their courage and sacrifice. No, I am talking about every one of you.</p>
<p>
<strong>You are why we continue our work to protect your right as parents to make the best decisions on behalf of your child. </strong>Because you’re the one who would literally lay down your life for your child. No court or bureaucrat or CPS investigator is going to do what you would do in a heartbeat.</p>
<p>This Mothers’ Day we thank you, Mom, for all you do. You are our hero!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<strong>Calls are urgently needed to urge Maine lawmakers to protect parental rights. </strong>
</p>
<p>A bill is pending, <a href="https://secure.parentalrights.org/neon/resource/parentalrights/files/Maine_proposal.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LD 472</a>, that would enact a law protecting the rights of parents. It sounds like a simple, obvious idea! But when I testified in favor of the bill during a committee hearing on May 2, some lawmakers seemed unsupportive.</p>
<p>
<strong>Your calls are crucial</strong> to convince them that the folks who put them in office–you!–want parental rights protected in the Maine law books. At least 10 other states have enacted parental rights statutes. Now it is time for Maine lawmakers to act–but they won’t unless they hear from you today, Monday, or Tuesday!</p>
<p>•••••••••••••••••••••••••<br>
<strong>ACTION REQUESTED</strong>
<br>
The committee handling the bill will vote on Wednesday, May 10. <strong>Please call today, Monday, or Tuesday!</strong>
</p>
<p>The members of the committee–the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary–are listed below. If your senator or representative is listed as a committee member, please call or email him or her. To find out who your senator and representative are, follow this link: <a href="https://openstates.org/find_your_legislator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://openstates.org/find_your_legislator/</a>.</p>
<p>Your message can be as simple as: “Please vote YES on LD 472. The right to make normal parental decisions needs to be written in the law books, and not left to the whims of judges.” Or you can read through the “Background” section below if you want some information to help craft your own personal message.</p>

<p>•••••••••••••••••••••••••<br>
<strong>BACKGROUND</strong>
<br>
There are three types of citizen rights: absolute, fundamental, and ordinary. Each type gets a different type of protection. If a right is absolute, the government can’t touch it. If a right is ordinary, the government can put virtually any restriction on it.</p>
<p>Between these two extremes are fundamental rights. When a right is labeled as fundamental, the government can restrict it only if it meets three criteria. (1) The need for a restriction must be compelling. (2) The type of restriction must be narrowly focused to meet the need. (3) And the restriction must cause the least possible actual constraint on the citizen that is required to get the job done. In the language of the courts, these three used together are called “strict scrutiny”.</p>
<p>The right to decide how your children are reared has been considered a fundamental right since 1925, according to the U.S. Supreme Court. (It has never been considered absolute.)</p>
<p>But in 2000, something incredibly confusing happened. The U.S. Supreme Court issued a decision (<em>Troxel v. Granville</em>) which SAID parental rights were fundamental but stunningly the Court refused to come right out and say whether parental rights deserve the protection of strict scrutiny that all other fundamental rights receive.</p>
<p>
<strong>With this deafening silence, many courts began assuming that the U.S. Constitution does not really require that a government restriction on parents pass the strict scrutiny test. </strong>Since then, more than 25 courts have refused to treat the rights of parents as deserving of strict scrutiny. In effect, those courts treated the rights of parents as if they had been downgraded to ordinary rights.</p>
<p>This “downgrading” has not happened in Maine courts–at least not yet. But as of today, there is absolutely nothing that would prevent a Maine judge from deciding to downgrade your right to rear your kids to an ordinary right and take away strict scrutiny protection. This would be a crushing blow to normal family relationships.</p>
<p>Think of how the government regulates welfare benefits, drivers licenses, banks and insurance companies–piles and piles of regulations! These regulations are rarely overturned because they restrict rights that are merely ordinary. That is how the government would be empowered to regulate parenting if parental rights are downgraded to ordinary.</p>
<p>Scotland recently treated parental rights as ordinary–and passed a law assigning a government agent to supervise every parent-child relationship.</p>
<p>How the U.S. Constitution is interpreted by judges will vary over time. But the U.S. Constitution is not the only source of citizen rights! State legislatures can–and often do–enact laws to protect rights. In fact, 10 states have decided to put parental rights on the books rather than let them toss in the wind with every new judicial decision.</p>
<p>Now it’s Maine’s turn.<strong> LD 472 is a simple, straightforward, uncomplicated solution. </strong>It puts into black and white that the rights of parents are fundamental and deserve the protection of strict scrutiny.</p>
<p>Because LD 472 merely puts into law what the Maine Supreme Court has already said (in <em>Rideout v. Riendeau</em>, for example), its enactment would actually cause no change whatsoever. Nor is it intended to cause change.<strong> It is intended to <em>prevent</em> a harmful change</strong>–the downgrading of parental rights in Maine to ordinary. It’s like a seatbelt–most of the time it makes no difference, but if you are in an accident, it could save you. LD 472 protects your right to raise your kids from the “accident” of a judge in Maine deciding it’s time to downgrade parental rights.</p>
<p>
<strong>LD 472 gives parents no new rights. </strong>Parents won’t be able to do anything <em>after</em> its enactment that they could <em>before</em> its enactment. It won’t impact compulsory attendance laws, child labor laws, or child abuse-neglect laws because those all pass the strict scrutiny test, as universally recognized.</p>
<p>A technical note: the <a href="http://secure.parentalrights.org/neon/resource/parentalrights/files/Maine_proposal.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">text of LD 472</a> that you will currently see on websites is not the final version. The sponsor is going to amend it on Wednesday to fully incorporate strict scrutiny protection.</p>
<p>Additional note: Homeschoolers of Maine, whose board includes ParentalRights.org State Coordinators Ed and Kathy Green, is united with us in supporting LD 472.</p>
<p>For additional detail, I invite you to read <a href="https://secure.parentalrights.org/neon/resource/parentalrights/files/ME%20LD%20472%20Parental%20Rights%20Scott%27s%20Testimony.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the written testimony I submitted to the committee on May 2</a>.</p>
<p>Thank you for standing with us for freedom!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Scott Woodruff, Attorney<br>
(who spoke on behalf of ParentalRights.org at a Maine Judiciary Committee hearing <span class="aBn">

<img src="https://secure.parentalrights.org/neon/resource/parentalrights/images/Woodruff.jpeg">
<strong>Tuesday morning, attorney Scott Woodruff </strong>spoke on behalf of ParentalRights.org before a hearing of the House Judiciary Committee of the Maine state legislature. Woodruff testified in support of <a href="http://legislature.maine.gov/LawMakerWeb/summary.asp?ID=280063180" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LD 472</a> as amended, a bill to protect the fundamental right of parents as a matter of state law.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Maine’s courts have a solid history of recognizing and respecting fundamental parental rights, which could prompt some critics to argue that LD 472 is unnecessary. But Scott rebuts this in the written testimony he shared with that committee.</p>
<p>“Judge-made law, or common law, is relevant only in areas where the legislature is silent,” Woodruff explains. “If the Maine legislature continues to be silent, the job of protecting parents will fall by default into the laps of judges. But this is the least satisfactory solution because <strong>judge-made law is the least democratic form of law.”</strong>
</p>
<p>What is more, the judicial precedent is already weakened at the federal level, which can work its way down to the states as well. Two of Maine’s most recent parental rights cases, <em>Rideout v. Riendeau</em> 2000 ME 198, 761 A.2d 291, and <em>Guardianship of David C.</em> 2010 ME 136, 10 A.3d 684, hold parental rights to be fundamental – but are built on a now-flawed base.</p>
<p>The Maine Supreme Court in <a href="http://caselaw.findlaw.com/me-supreme-judicial-court/1001383.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
<em>Rideout</em>
</a> summarizes Maine’s historic position very clearly: “[The Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment] provides heightened protection against state intervention in parents’ fundamental right to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children… [which] mandates strict scrutiny.”</p>
<p>But the court in <em>Rideout</em>, as in the later <em>David C.</em>, cites the U.S. Supreme Court’s <em>Troxel</em> ruling in making its judgment. Frankly (and commendably), the Maine court found a rudder to steer by in spite of the <em>Troxel</em> decision, and not because of it. This is this same <em>Troxel</em> case for which Justice Thomas wrote in his concurring opinion that although “[t]he opinions of the plurality, Justice Kennedy, and Justice Souter recognize such a [fundamental] right… curiously none of them articulates the appropriate standard of review. I would apply strict scrutiny to infringements of fundamental rights.”</p>
<p>
<img src="https://secure.parentalrights.org/neon/resource/parentalrights/images/MP900408864cropped.jpg">
</p>
<p>
<strong>To put it simply, the very case on which Maine’s strict scrutiny standard now rests is one in which six U.S. Supreme Court justices did away with the strict scrutiny standard.</strong>
</p>
<p>Is it hard to imagine that state judges may one day follow the same path and do away with this heightened level of protection for your rights? It has already happened in several states, including California.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://caselaw.findlaw.com/ca-court-of-appeal/1240292.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
<em>Fenn v. Sheriff</em>
</a>, the California Court of Appeals declared, “The decision of father and his wife about whether and under what conditions grandparents should have visitation with their grandchildren is entitled to ‘special weight’ under <em>Troxel</em> – assuming both are fit parents – but no more.”</p>
<p>
<strong>Sadly, a large majority of the states where parental rights are protected are relying on judge-made law rooted in <em>Troxel</em>.</strong> There is nothing stopping judges in these states from reaching the same conclusion as the California court, removing real protection for parental rights with the stroke of a pen.</p>
<p>In ten states, however, that is not the case. In ten states, the legislatures have not remained silent, and judges have a clear statutory direction on parental rights cases regardless of <em>Troxel</em> or any other case law. In states as different as Nevada, Arizona, Oklahoma, and Virginia, parental rights are protected as fundamental and protected by strict scrutiny as a matter of state law.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://secure.parentalrights.org/neon/resource/parentalrights/images/family.jpg">
</p>
<p>
<strong>Ultimately, the proposed Parental Rights Amendment will put these rights – and their heightened protection – into the text of the U.S. Constitution</strong>, protecting families in every state. Until that happens, though, we continue to work in the states to bring about protection via statute.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we also continue to work on amending federal laws to protect parents. Last week ParentalRights.org President Jim Mason met with the head of the Federalist Society to discuss plans to improve the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA) when it comes up for renewal later this year. No federal law should provide monetary incentives to states to ignore or abuse the parental rights that keep our families safe.</p>
<p>Thank you for standing with us as we work to preserve parental rights through all of these efforts. If you have not done so lately, perhaps you could <strong>take a moment today to <a href="https://secure.parentalrights.org/np/clients/parentalrights/donation.jsp?campaign=5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">send a donation</a> to ParentalRights.org</strong> to help us continue the work? Regardless, we are thankful for your important place on our nationwide team.</p>

<em>ParentalRights.org’s Michael Ramey meets with Maine Reps. Espling (right) and Sampson</em>
</p>
<p>Dear Parental Rights Champion in Maine,</p>
<p>It is time to mobilize for parental rights here in our state!</p>
<p>
<strong>A public hearing for the Maine Parental Rights bill, <a href="http://www.mainelegislature.org/legis/bills/display_ps.asp?ld=472&amp;PID=1456&amp;snum=128&amp;sec3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LD 472</a>, has been scheduled for Tuesday, May 2</strong>, at 1:00 p.m. in room 438 of the State House in Augusta. This is our chance to voice our support for protecting families in our state by preserving the role of parents in directing the upbringing, education, and care of their children.</p>
<p>
<strong>If it is possible for you to be in Augusta on Tuesday</strong>, here’s what we would ask you to do:</p>
<p>Be ready to share a brief testimony (no more than 3 minutes – really short!) of why you believe parental rights should be protected. Write up your testimony beforehand and have 20 copies ready to distribute.</p>
<p>Also, you’ll need to<strong> email a copy to the Judiciary Committee</strong> just prior to the hearing date (that is, email it on Monday). You can find a <a href="http://legislature.maine.gov/house/jt_com/jud.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">list of the committee members here</a>, including links to their email addresses.</p>
<p>Your testimony doesn’t have to be elaborate, and no one is grading you on it. You just have to be sincere in your stand for parental rights.</p>
<p>Of course, <strong>if you are not able to share testimony, we would still invite you to attend</strong> the hearing in support of parental rights.</p>
<p>And <strong>if you are not able to be in Augusta on Tuesday at all, please stay tuned</strong>. We anticipate needing additional emails or phone calls of support in the next couple of weeks. Be watching for future notices with more details.</p>
<p>Note: The bill as it currently appears on the Maine legislative website is not the bill as it will be discussed on Tuesday. The language as originally drafted would serve as a “shared parenting” bill rather than as a fundamental rights bill. But the bill’s author, Rep. Espling, plans to present an amendment on Tuesday based on the language to be <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Maine_proposal.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">found here</a>, which will replace the current version. <strong>ParentalRights.org fully supports this amended version of the bill.</strong>
</p>
<p>Thank you for standing with us and making your voice heard for parents throughout our state!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Ed and Kathy Green<br>
Maine State Coordinators</p>

<![CDATA[<p>
<em>Picture: ParentalRights.org President Jim Mason and Gov’t Relations Director Will Estrada on Capitol Hill with Diane Redleaf of The Family Defense Center and Suzanne Sellers of Families Organizing for Child Welfare Justice, part of a 12-member coalition for parental rights</em>
</p>
<p>ParentalRights.org President Jim Mason met with Senator Lindsey Graham’s staff last Tuesday to lay the groundwork for reintroducing the Parental Rights Amendment (PRA) in the U.S. Senate very soon. (Stay tuned for details in the coming weeks.)</p>
<p>Then on Thursday we met with the staff of one senator and those of three representatives in company with a bipartisan group of family-advocacy partners who all agree—federal child welfare laws need to change to better protect children and families.</p>
<p>
<strong>As the day went on a theme emerged: forcibly removing a child from his or her parents’ home is itself a source of trauma.</strong>
</p>
<p>In cases of actual abuse or intentional neglect, sometimes child removal is, sadly, unavoidable.</p>
<p>But studies have shown that children in borderline child welfare cases left with their families fare much better later in life than children in the same exact kinds of cases who are removed to foster care. It turns out that in such cases, removal from the home actually does more harm than the risks it is supposed to solve.</p>
<p>That’s one reason protecting fundamental parental rights is so important: to keep children with their parents where they belong. And it is to that end that we are championing state and federal legislation, and ultimately the Parental Rights Amendment.</p>
<p>Every office we visited found the political breadth of our coalition eye-opening and encouraging. <strong>Parents’ right to protect children is an issue on which nearly all Americans can agree, regardless of political leanings or affiliation.</strong>
</p>
<p>Our Thursday meetings also served to introduce us and our organization to a wider array of congressional staff. And that’s another point: as we work to fix parental rights issues in federal law now, we also build bridges that will be helpful in passing the Parental Rights Amendment in the months ahead.</p>
<p>Passing an amendment requires a two-thirds majority in both the House and Senate, so there’s no way either party would ever be able to pass the PRA on its own. But by working with a broad coalition, we hope to build bridges to members of Congress who may one day stand with us for the Amendment.</p>
<p>We remain hard at work to advance the Amendment. Your <a href="https://secure.parentalrights.org/np/clients/parentalrights/donation.jsp?campaign=5&amp;=&amp;utm_source=email" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">generous support today</a> will help to fuel these on-going efforts to preserve parental rights.</p>
<p>One congressional staffer we met with Thursday told us, “I’m a mother myself, and I’m happy to be a friend to you all on this issue.”<strong> It’s only because of you that we were there and now have a friend in a key office to fight for parental rights.</strong>
</p>
<p>Thank you for continuing to stand with us as we press forward for the protection of our families. Together we can see exciting victories in the days just ahead!</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Between health care bills, Neil Gorsuch, and the Russian election investigation, one thing is painfully clear: <strong>Congress is as divided now as it has ever been. </strong>Democrats and Republicans, seemingly never quick to collaborate, are having even more trouble than usual finding common ground.</p>
<p>
<strong>So how can we bring them together?</strong>
</p>
<p>To pass an amendment to the Constitution (such as the proposed Parental Rights Amendment, or PRA) requires a two-thirds vote in each chamber of Congress. That means 290 members of the House, plus 67 Senators, all agreeing on the same thing. It almost defies imagination.</p>
<p>But then, most issues are not as staunchly supported across the political spectrum as are parental rights.</p>
<p>According to a 2010 Zogby poll, more than 90% of Americans, regardless of party, support the traditional view that, absent a showing of abuse or neglect, parents have the right to make decisions for their children without government interference. More than 92% of Democrats and 97% of Republicans agreed with this view. Independents surpassed 90%, even with a significant 4.5% answering “not sure.”</p>
<p>We have seen no evidence of public sentiment changing in the last few years, either. In a society divided by almost everything, <strong>we stand together on this.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>And that gives us a real chance to make headway in Congress in the coming months.</strong>
</p>
<p>We’ve spoken with an East Coast Republican ready to take the lead on parental rights in the House. We sat down with a Southwest Democrat’s staff who wondered, “Why aren’t there any Democrats on this?” We’ve spoken with a Midwest Democrat who told us, “This is real; I’ve seen this in my district,” and with another Republican who tells us, “I’ve worked with that Democrat; maybe I can help bring them on board.”</p>
<p>In a similar vein, we are working with organizations across the political spectrum to draft amendments to federal CAPTA law–the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act–to halt the use of federal funds in sponsoring programs that separate families and damage children. In this area, too, we believe we can find common cause for both parties.</p>
<p>Yes, parental rights need Congress; it is they who can send the PRA to the States for ratification. But just maybe Congress needs parental rights, as well–a common cause both parties can get behind.</p>
<p>
<strong>But it won’t happen without your help.</strong>
</p>
<p>First, there will be times when we will need you (and your family and friends!) to contact lawmakers and urge them to support the PRA or other parental rights legislation. This is how we can turn those outstanding polling numbers into solid majorities in Congress as well. So please <strong>urge your friends to <a href="http://4pra.us/sign" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sign up now</a> </strong>so they’ll get those alerts and can make their voices heard!</p>
<p>But <strong>we also need your <a href="http://secure.parentalrights.org/np/clients/parentalrights/donation.jsp?campaign=5&amp;=&amp;utm_source=email" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">financial support</a>. </strong>We are the only national organization exclusively focused on parental rights, the only group founded to realize the Parental Rights Amendment, and we are 100% donor-supported. That means our resources and our reach are defined by your generosity.</p>
<p>So would you please take a moment to make your <a href="https://secure.parentalrights.org/np/clients/parentalrights/donation.jsp?campaign=5&amp;=&amp;utm_source=email" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">most generous donation</a> today? We will put those dollars toward passing new state laws, amending federal regulations, and ultimately winning key bipartisan support to permanently protect the rights of all parents in the text of the Constitution.</p>
<p>Thank you for standing with us, today and always, whether with your donations, your phone calls, or simply spreading the word. We would have no chance of success apart from you.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<![CDATA[<p>[Video at <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4662743/judge-gorsuch-international-law" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4662743/judge-gorsuch-international-law</a>]</p>
<p>Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch last week fielded a question from Senator Ben Sasse (R- Nebraska) regarding the application of international law in judicial interpretation. In years past, this question has been a vital part of the discussion of parental rights, due to concerns that international treaties and precedents might provide a means to override parental rights in American courts. So we took great interest in Gorsuch’s answer, featured in the video below.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4662743/judge-gorsuch-international-law" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
<img src="http://parentalrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/video-neil-gorsuch-300x180.jpeg">
</a>
</p>
<p>Senator Sasse asked, “As a sitting Supreme Court Justice tasked with upholding the U.S. Constitution, is it ever appropriate to cite international law? And if so, why?”</p>
<p>After naming specific, limited instances in which such reference would be “not just proper but necessary,” Gorsuch proclaimed that, “as a general matter, Senator, I would say it’s improper to look abroad when interpreting the Constitution.”</p>
<p>To be clear, ParentalRights.org as an organization does not hold a position on the Gorsuch nomination. But we do like his answer to this one question on this one issue.</p>
<p>In fact, if all Supreme Court justices and federal judges were in agreement on this question, Section Six of the proposed Parental Rights Amendment would not be necessary. That section states, “No treaty may be adopted, nor shall any source of international law be employed to supersede, modify, interpret, or apply to the rights guaranteed by this article.”</p>
<p>But since not all justices agree with this point, we look to this section of the Parental Rights Amendment, not new Supreme Court justices, to protect our rights from this threat.</p>
<p>While we like Neil Gorsuch’s response to this question, however, we do not see him as a savior for parental rights on the Court. The media have often likened Gorusch to his predecessor, Antonin Scalia, as a champion of the “originalist” view of legal interpretation. But that very position led Scalia to declare in the <em>Troxel </em>case that <strong>the Constitution’s silence on parents’ rights renders him <em>powerless to protect them.</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>In his dissent, Scalia wrote, “while I would think it entirely compatible with the commitment to representative democracy set forth in the founding documents to argue, in legislative chambers or in electoral campaigns, that the State has <em>no power</em> to interfere with parents’ authority over the rearing of their children, I do not believe that the power which the Constitution confers upon me <em>as a judge </em>entitles me to deny legal effect to laws that (in my view) infringe upon what is (in my view) that unenumerated right.”</p>
<p>If Gorsuch follows Scalia’s path, he would provide no more protection for parents’ rights than Scalia did.</p>
<p>This, also, is a reason to adopt the Parental Rights Amendment. <strong>Only by putting the fundamental right of parents to direct the upbringing of their children into the Constitution can we protect it from both international and domestic legal challenges.</strong>
</p>
<p>There is no such thing as a perfect Supreme Court justice – and we certainly could never find nine of them! In their absence, parental rights must be protected in the text of the Constitution instead.</p>
<p>
<strong>Regardless of who next puts on that robe, we want the entire Court bound by the principle that innocent parents make the best decisions for their children. </strong>With your help, we can secure that very protection through passage of the Parental Rights Amendment.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>
<em>Picture: ParentalRights.org’s Michael Ramey meets with Maine Reps. Espling (right) and Sampson</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>[Sent 3/21/17] </em>
</p>
<p>Last week I was privileged to attend the Homeschoolers of Maine conference in Rockport. While there, I was able not only to share the important work of ParentalRights.org with hundreds of concerned home educators, but also to <strong>meet with Maine lawmakers who are championing pro-parent legislation in Augusta. </strong>
</p>
<p>Rep. Espling reached out to ParentalRights.org several months ago and received a copy of our model legislation to use as a starting point for a bill in Maine (<a href="http://legislature.maine.gov/LawMakerWeb/summary.asp?ID=280063180" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HB 335</a>). Then, as the session got started, Rep. Sampson reached out as well. We were then able to connect the two and look forward to continuing to work with this passionate team that is leading the way for parents in the northeast corner of the country.</p>
<p>HOME also allowed me to present a workshop on parental rights as a last-minute fill-in for a speaker unable to attend. With little time to prepare, I pulled out a presentation I last made in Pennsylvania in August that details the history of parental rights through the Supreme Court. (<a href="http://www.parentalrights.org/northeast#ME" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Read more about the Maine trip.</a>)</p>
<p>Perhaps it was fitting, then, to return to the office this morning and find that<strong> Rep. Tallman has also just introduced parental rights legislation in Pennsylvania </strong>like that presented in Maine. Tallman’s <a href="http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billinfo/billinfo.cfm?syear=2017&amp;sind=0&amp;body=H&amp;type=B&amp;bn=855" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HB 855</a>, which also follows our model language, would establish in statute that parental rights are fundamental, and that they can only be overridden to serve a compelling state interest by the least restrictive means – the standard known as “strict scrutiny” review.</p>
<p>We will keep you posted as these bills continue their path through their respective legislatures in Maine and Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>In addition, <strong>if you live in either of these states and have a personal story </strong>of how your parental rights have been infringed, I would ask you to please send a brief email of your account to <a href="mailto:stories@parentalrights.org">stories@parentalrights.org</a> and use the subject line of Maine Stories or Pennsylvania Stories (as appropriate). We will forward these stories to the lawmakers there who may be able to use them as they champion these bills.</p>
<p>If you have friends in either of these states who value their right to make the decisions they know are best for their children, why not <strong>forward this email </strong>to them and encourage them to sign up with us using the sign-up link <a href="http://4pra.us/sign">here</a>? That way we can inform them as these bills progress so they can lend their voices to those of other parental rights champions in their states. For that matter, why not enlist your friends in <em>any</em> state? Then they will be part of the solution when the legislative battle reaches <em>their</em> backyard.</p>
<p>This weekend was a real encouragement to me. I am excited by all we can do in the months ahead as we work together for the cause of families. Thank you for standing with us!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<strong>Maine Trip Report by Michael Ramey, ParentalRights.org</strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>March 20, 2017</em>
</p>
<p>Last week, I was privileged to attend the Homeschoolers of Maine conference in Rockport. While there I was able not only to share the important work of ParentalRights.org with hundreds of concerned home educators, but also to meet with Maine lawmakers who are championing pro-parent legislation in Augusta.</p>
<p>State Representatives Ellie Espling and Heidi Sampson took time out to visit the conference on Friday afternoon. While they were there, the three of us presented updates on the status of parental rights and our efforts in the legislature. Then we met together with a couple of local organizations to discuss the challenges we may face and how to overcome them as we champion these parental rights bills this session.</p>
<p>Rep. Espling reached out to ParentalRights.org several months ago and received a copy of our model legislation to use as a starting point for a bill in Maine (<a href="http://legislature.maine.gov/LawMakerWeb/summary.asp?ID=280063180">HB 335</a>). Then, as the session got started, Rep. Sampson reached out as well. When I offered to put her in touch with a lawmaker who was already working on parental rights, she was excited (but not really surprised) to learn that the sponsor was already a dear friend. Together, these ladies are a passionate team leading the way for parents in the northeast corner of the country.</p>
<p>HOME also allowed me to present a workshop on parental rights as a last-minute fill-in for a speaker unable to attend. With little time to prepare, I pulled out a presentation I last made in Pennsylvania in August that details the history of parental rights through the Supreme Court.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>We were steps from the finish line, yet it suddenly appeared victory would be snatched from our grasp. The fate of <a href="https://openstates.org/wy/bills/2017/HB153/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">House Bill 153</a> on Parental Rights in the Wyoming Senate came down to the last minute, and tested our ability – <em>your</em> ability – to respond quickly.</p>
<p>
<strong>The drama began Thursday, February 23,</strong> when volunteer State Coordinator Jan Loftus alerted us that time was running out: Rep. Mark Jennings had expertly guided House bill 153 to passage in the Wyoming House, 50-7, in January. But if it wasn’t placed on the Senate calendar by the next day (Feb. 24), there wouldn’t be time for it to pass. So we alerted our Wyoming supporters, who contacted the senators in charge of scheduling and urged them to hear the bill. Rep. Jennings and some of his colleagues reached out as well. By Thursday night, the bill was scheduled for first read on Friday.</p>
<p>Friday morning I had the privilege of speaking with Sen. Kinskey, who would speak for the bill in the Senate. We discussed areas of pushback he could anticipate, such as a clear understanding of the <a href="https://parentalrights.org/amendment/why_we_need_it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
<em>Troxel</em> Supreme Court case</a> that makes a bill like this necessary.</p>
<p>Friday afternoon, after a floor debate that included support from Sen. Anthony Bouchard and the answers we’d worked out with Sen. Kinskey, the bill passed on first reading by a vote of 17-10. It looked like a victory, but it would not pass final (3<sup>rd</sup>) reading if the Senate remained split. Changes would have to be made by the next session day – and now it was Friday night.</p>
<p>
<strong>The weekend involved emails between ParentalRights.org and our contacts in Wyoming.</strong> How could we respond to those who feared parents suing schools over curriculum? Would this harm Wyoming’s grandparent visitation law? Could this or that be amended or cut?</p>
<p>Finally, 2<sup>nd</sup> reading on Monday saw an amended version of HB 153 that would satisfy most of the senators who had concerns, without hurting the purpose of the measure. The aim of HB 153 – to secure parental rights as fundamental rights protected by strict judicial scrutiny – remained within reach. And it passed 2<sup>nd</sup> reading. We were one step away from victory!</p>
<p>
<strong>Then came the last-second plot twist. </strong>Tuesday, 11:40 a.m. Eastern Time (9:40 a.m. in Wyoming) we got word that an amendment would be proposed to strip out “Section B” of the bill – the section containing strict scrutiny protection.</p>
<p>
<strong>We had to get pressure on senators to reject the amendment. </strong>HB 153 without Section B would serve no purpose at all. But it was already too late; the session would start in 20 minutes.</p>
<p>We knew Sen. Kinskey would stand firm to protect the purpose of the bill. And Sen. Bouchard knew (he asked, so we told him) that if the bill lost Section B, we saw no reason to pass it. So he, too, would stand against the effort to change it.</p>
<p>But where would the support they needed come from? There was no way to get the message out in time, so we sent it anyway and hoped for a miracle.</p>
<p>Then we got one.</p>
<p>Bills up for 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> reading are generally taken up before lunchtime, but that day things moved slowly. And since HB 153 was the only contested bill up for 3<sup>rd</sup> reading, it was shoved to the bottom of the pile.</p>
<p>
<strong>That means senators broke for lunch – and got to hear from their constituents – </strong>before the bill came up for discussion.</p>
<p>We don’t know how many emails the senators received. We do know that the threatened amendment was brought to the floor Tuesday afternoon and failed, 9 in favor to 21 against. Then HB 153, with strict scrutiny still intact, received its final Senate vote and passed 25 to 5.</p>
<p>Wyoming’s parental rights bill is not law yet. Though the House voted March 1 to concur with the Senate’s amended version by a vote of 53-7, it still awaits the governor’s signature. [Breaking: The governor has scheduled a bill signing for HB 153 on Thursday, March 9, at 1:30 p.m.] But we believe the real moment of decision was Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<p>
<strong>Wyoming supporters came through and made their voices heard.</strong>
</p>
<p>We are grateful for the opportunity to work with parental rights heroes like House sponsor Mark Jennings, Senators Kinskey and Bouchard, and each of our Wyoming supporters who called or emailed last week. Together we are able to accomplish great things for the cause of families and parental rights!</p>
<p>I am also grateful for each one of you. When we ask you to email or call, you get the job done. When we need you to alert us to bad bills or help us champion good ones, you rise to the occasion. And your <a href="https://secure.parentalrights.org/np/clients/parentalrights/donation.jsp?campaign=5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">financial support</a> is literally the only means for our survival. <strong>Our organization would not exist without you!</strong>
</p>
<p>So, thank you for standing with us as we champion parental rights in the states and in the U.S. Congress. The prize remains before us; let’s go take it!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Dear Champion of Parental Rights in Oklahoma:</p>
<p>
<strong>I want to alert you to a profound and dangerous threat to your right to protect the health of your children, </strong>a threat we need to deal with immediately. <a href="http://www.oklegislature.gov/BillInfo.aspx?Bill=SB%2083" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Senate Bill 83</a> authored by Senator Yen seeks to modify the traditional right of parents to make their own informed medical decision for their children regarding vaccination. As we who have followed this situation know, Senator Yen wants to see Oklahoma remove <em>all</em> vaccination choice from parents.</p>
<p>Originally, SB 83 sought to eliminate personal and religious exemptions to vaccinations. However, thanks to the excellent work of grass roots activists, we were able to educate enough legislators to the problems with mandatory vaccinations and Senator Yen was not able to get the bill out of committee.</p>
<p>In a last minute move, he changed the language of SB 83 to say that if a parent wants to exercise the personal or religious exemption for their child, they must watch a video to be produced by the Health Dept. On the surface, this compromise looks reasonable because it leaves the personal exemption intact. <strong>
<em> However, when looked at in detail, SB 83 remains dangerous and should be opposed at all costs!</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>We need your help to make sure SB 83 dies on the Senate floor. Here are the talking points you can use when you contact your Senators (and Reps as well, since we should be laying the ground work now):</p>
<p>1. Several years ago, Oklahoma passed HB1384 which was a <strong>Parent’s Bill of Rights.</strong> That law says that Oklahoma recognizes a parent’s fundamental right to direct the upbringing, healthcare, and education of their child. If, as a principle, the Oklahoma legislature recognizes these fundamental rights of parents, then it cannot in good conscience pass any law that would so severely restrict those rights, especially on the false premise of a “public health crisis”.</p>
<p>2. SB 83 assumes that individuals who follow a personalized vaccine schedule for their children are uneducated. <strong>It assumes such parents are incapable of making the best decision for their child.</strong>
</p>
<p>3. SB 83 introduces a slippery slope. If it passes, <strong>parents will be required to watch a video before they can exercise their rights.</strong> That is one step closer to removing the personal exemption altogether. Senator Yen has stated his intention to remove all religious and personal exemptions for all children in public or private schools and day cares. (And if they fall, how long will it be before the mandate reaches homeschoolers also?)</p>
<p>4. <strong>The tax payers are going to be required to pay for both the creation of this video and the technology required to monitor who has watched it. </strong>A similar video in Oregon cost $75,000 to make. SB83 would require that parents can watch the video on a website, but that the website cannot collect any personal information. That is technologically very difficult and could prove very expensive. This bill is poorly thought out; the consequences and cost of execution cannot be determined.</p>
<p>5. The video will be produced by the health department, which has a <strong>conflict of interest.</strong> Given the health department’s stated goal of increasing vaccination rates, it is clear the video will not best serve children, or parents seeking to make the best possible medical decision for them.</p>
<p>
<strong>Action Item</strong>
</p>
<p>We cannot afford to give any ground that will lead us closer to mandatory vaccination for all (and the removal of a parent’s right to decide). So we are reaching out to all of our friends in Oklahoma; <em>we need your help!</em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Please, call or visit your Senator at the Capitol this week and tell them to vote no on SB83. </strong>To find your state senator go to <a href="http://www.oklegislature.gov/FindMyLegislature.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.oklegislature.gov/FindMyLegislature.aspx</a>
</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Tracey Montgomery<br>
Oklahoma State Coordinator</p>

<![CDATA[<p>The editorial board of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram ran a <a href="http://www.star-telegram.com/opinion/editorials/article134139659.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blistering commentary</a> on Tuesday (Feb. 21) about the state’s damaged Child Protective Services (CPS) agency and the rise of child sex trafficking.</p>
<p>
<strong>“The child welfare system is in desperate need of reform,”</strong> the board wrote, paired with this tragic statement: “No child should ever be in the position that a pimp is the most appealing option for housing and food.”</p>
<p>For this reason ParentalRights.org is proud to be working with other organizations in a national coalition to <strong>promote reform at the federal level.</strong> We believe we can help sort out problems at the state level by improving the rules imposed on the states to receive federal funds.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there are two Texas bills (unrelated to CPS) that we can get behind.</p>
<p>Both bills deal with “conservatorship,” the term used in Texas law to refer to the legal rights and responsibilities involved in the parent-child relationship. “Conservatorship” in Texas is synonymous with “custody” in most other states.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://legiscan.com/TX/bill/SB816/2017" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SB816</a> incorporates a presumption that a parent is a fit parent (unless clear evidence shows otherwise) into the “best interest of the child” standard when it is applied to original conservatorship decisions (not just the modifications). Such decisions would include separation or divorce situations as well as CPS investigations.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://legiscan.com/TX/bill/SB815/2017" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SB815</a> incorporates the legal presumption that appointing parents rather than CPS or another adult as their child’s conservator is in their child’s best interest. Similar presumptions already exist in many parts of Texas law, but it has not been specified in instances when a conservator (custody) arrangement is up for modification.</li>
</ul>
<p>By monitoring and supporting bills like these and working to change federal and state laws, we can protect children by empowering parents. But we can’t do it alone! <strong>It’s your <a href="https://secure.parentalrights.org/np/clients/parentalrights/donation.jsp?campaign=5&amp;">continued support</a> that enables us to stand up for this vital cause.</strong> Thank you for your partnership in protecting children.</p>

<p>Over the last couple of decades we have seen the emergence of a lobby that believes in giving power to "experts" to seek the good of all children. Nevertheless parents continue to defend their right to make the best individualized decisions for their child. <strong>We are seeing that tension between parent and professional become more entrenched each year.</strong>

</a>This year has seen a <strong>rise in the number of appeals </strong>in which an earlier guilty verdict from a charge of "shaken baby syndrome" or "medical child abuse" has been thrown out. These appeals are rising as reports and expert witnesses show flaws in the science behind those convictions. Parent and child advocates like <a href="http://parentalrightsfoundation.org/medical_ethics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Diane Redleaf</a> at the Family Defense Center in Chicago and law professor <a href="http://parentalrightsfoundation.org/bad_medicine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maxine Eichner</a> at the University of North Carolina are exposing the legal and ethical issues that arise when doctors act in a forensic role (gathering evidence against parents) rather than in the traditional care-giving role of their field.</p>
<p>As wonderful as modern medicine is and as helpful as most doctors are, they are not perfect. Sadly, <strong>medical error is the <a href="https://www.aol.com/article/2016/05/03/medical-errors-are-third-leading-cause-of-death-in-the-us/21369851/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#3 cause of death in our country</a> according to a 2016 report. </strong>And even the best doctors are rarely in a better position than a loving parent to make the difficult decisions for a child.</p>
<p>The family of <a href="http://www.fox25boston.com/news/family-of-justina-pelletier-announces-lawsuit-against-boston-childrens-hospital/112745822" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Justina Pelletier</a> found that out the hard way in 2014 when the state of Massachusetts took Justina from them and placed her in the custody of Boston Children's Hospital. Doctors there were free to enroll her in clinical trials (without parental consent) for the somatoform disorder diagnosis they had given her, rather than continuing the treatment for Mitochondrial disease that her parents and doctors at Tufts Medical Center had been following. After public outrage following her parents going public, Justina was finally returned to her parents 16 months later, in much worse condition than when she was taken away. <strong>Her story reemerged in 2016 as the family filed suit in federal court against the state and the hospital who so severely injured their daughter.</strong>

He was finally released by the state of Illinois who had been granted custody (though he was never a resident of the state until he went into foster care) when Lurie Children's Hospital (Chicago) doctors decided they knew better than his mom. While in foster care, Rider suffered sexual assault. He was finally returned to the custody of his grandparents in his home state, but <strong>wasn't fully released from Illinois care until June of 2016, months after his 18<sup>th</sup> birthday!</strong>

</a>As sad as it sounds, though, the Riders and the Pelletiers are the lucky ones. A <a href="http://nypost.com/2016/01/17/hospitals-killed-our-baby-and-then-tried-to-blame-us-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">family in New York</a> found themselves facing allegations of child abuse after their infant died at the hands of New York doctors, according to a lawsuit filed last year. The suit alleges that the Long Island infant was pumped full of a "cornucopia of drugs," including Propofol, "the powerful sedative linked to Michael Jackson's death" according to a NY Post article. As the baby lay dying, Suffolk County social workers and a "pediatric child abuse specialist" were accusing the parents of shaking her to death, a charge the parents contend was fabricated to cover up the hospital's own serious errors in the child's treatment. <strong>The couple's two older children were taken from their care, but returned after two autopsies of the baby showed no signs of criminality. </strong>The child protection agency kept its case open for 11 long months, and is now a codefendant in the suit.</p>
<p>Two other cases, one in <a href="https://healthimpactnews.com/2015/cps-threatens-to-kidnap-7-year-old-in-california-when-parents-try-to-transfer-to-different-hospital/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">California</a> and another in <a href="http://medicalkidnap.com/2016/11/11/tennessee-children-with-brittle-bones-suffer-in-state-care-as-mom-charged-with-sbs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tennessee</a>, also saw the <strong>state take children away from loving parents over a disagreement in the child's diagnosis and treatment.</strong>
</p>
<p>Yet even as the evidence is showing more and more the fallibility of the medical profession, states are heeding doctors' and pharmaceutical companies' urgings to clamp down on parents' rights in medical decisions. California in 2015 notoriously passed SB 277, a bill to remove from parents the right to make an informed medical decision regarding their child's vaccinations. Similar bills were introduced in 19 other states but failed to pass. Proponents of these bills, though, are undeterred, as evidenced by the number of states dealing with similar measures again this legislative session – already as many as 30.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<img src="http://parentalrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/drugs-295x300.jpeg">In the medical sub-category of psychotropic drugs,</strong> parental rights have seen a slight improvement. Though most psychotropic drugs are not approved by the FDA for use by adolescents, many localities have nevertheless required their prescription to students who misbehave in school. <a href="https://parentalrights.org/understand_the_issue/current-state-parental-rights/medical#godboldo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maryanne Godboldo of Detroit</a> made national headlines 3 years ago when she barricaded herself and her daughter in her apartment and refused to let the city force her 13-year-old to receive Risperdol. The ensuing standoff brought out the SWAT team, a tank, and the national news.</p>
<p>Maryanne's own case was finally resolved this year when charges – which had been filed or appealed 5 separate times – were finally dropped. Sadly, they were dropped only because Godboldo suffered a massive aneurysm and is not expected to recover from her current comatose state.</p>
<p>But in the state of New Mexico, <a href="http://www.prisonplanet.com/new-mexico-bans-forced-psychiatric-drugging-of-children.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">real progress has been made</a>. That state in 2015 passed a law prohibiting a parent's choice to withhold psychotropic medications from being used as the sole basis for removal of a child. A New Mexico mother in Godboldo's situation will no longer have to barricade herself in her home in the first place. If she determines that Risperdol is dangerous, that New Mexico mom can rest easy in the knowledge that no one will be coming for her child.</p>

<p>••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••<br> <strong>Parental Rights in Education</strong>
<br> <em>
<strong>General Direction: </strong>Things are getting worse. </em>
</p>
<p>As with medical care, the area of education also sees the tension between parents and a group of professional elites who believe they can better make decisions for all children. This mindset can be seen in a Mississippi bill introduced last year which would <strong>
<a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/03/10/mississippi-house-passes-bill-requiring-teachers-to-grade-parents.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">require public school teachers to give parents a grade</a>. </strong>No, not their children's grades – but an actual grade of their own. Are you involved in your child's education? Attend conferences? Don't give the teacher a lot of push back or ask too many questions? Then you would get an "A". On the other hand, if you cause too much trouble, you could get a failing mark. The bill actually passed the Mississippi House, but fortunately did not make it into law.</p>
<p>The march toward elitist control is a scary one, though. In 2015 the Administration argued in <em>Romeike v. Holder</em> that the right of a parent to decide the kind of education their child will receive is not a human right sufficient to grant refugee status to those robbed of it. The right, articulated in the <em>Universal Declaration of Human Rights </em>1948, was internationally adopted directly to prevent a recurrence of Hitler's plan to indoctrinate German students by requiring that they all attend the Nazis' state-run schools. Ironically, the Romeikes were fleeing Germany's use of the very same law that precipitated that declaration in the first place.</p>
<p>Most startling of all, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed with the Administration in the <em>Romeike</em> case. Your right to choose your child's education is not sufficient for a refugee – will it still be sufficient for you?</p>

</a>Before you say "Yes" too quickly, consider that one school system chose to <strong>
<a href="http://thinkaboutnow.com/2016/04/campus-bans-parents-from-walking-children-to-school/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ban parents from walking their own children</a> to school. </strong>And in Virginia, Governor Terry McAuliffe vetoed a bill that would require schools to alert parents when a required <a href="http://www.richmond.com/news/article_23efd27d-0499-5bdb-ae13-fa099de04f35.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reading assignment will contain sexually explicit material</a>. Parents who championed the bill were able to persuade lawmakers of the need when, in multiple instances, school officials and lawmakers themselves had to ask parents to stop reading sample passages because they were "obscene" or "indecent." Yet the governor decided that warning parents of the material would interfere too much in the education process.</p>
<p>Or consider the state of New York, which apparently has determined that, while homeschooling is clearly not against the law, it is also not to be tolerated. Mother <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE29vPaaSb0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kiarre Harris</a> decided in December 2016 to remove her two children from Buffalo's failing schools. Per state law, she filed all of the required paperwork with Buffalo City Hall and told the school she was beginning to homeschool the youngsters. A few weeks later, Child Protective Services and the police showed up to take her kids. When she wouldn't reveal where the children were, she was arrested and jailed on obstruction charges, while her children were located and taken to foster care.</p>
<p>Home School Legal Defense Association recently <a href="http://thefederalist.com/2017/02/04/families-sue-nyc-reporting-child-services-homeschool/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">filed suit against New York</a> for routinely doing this very thing: <strong>charging "truancy" and taking children away from parents </strong>who have fulfilled all of the statutory requirements to teach their children at home. New York law permits parents to choose this educational alternative, but the state's message is clear: if you make that choice, we will fabricate a reason to take your child.</p>

<br> <em>
<strong>General Direction: </strong>Things continue to be a mess. </em>
</p>
<p>An Arizona appeals court had to overturn a family court termination of parental rights (TPR) order that was based on a <a href="http://www.azfamily.com/story/33139874/ruling-dont-end-parental-rights-due-to-1-lapse-of-watching" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">single lapse in supervision</a> by a caring parent. The case involved a 6-year-old whose father has joint legal custody with his ex-wife.</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.theindianalawyer.com/coa-reverses-termination-of-parental-rights-finds-dcs-exhibited-troubling-behavior/PARAMS/article/42344" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
<img src="http://parentalrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Screen-Shot-2017-02-17-at-1_09_40-PM-270x300.png">
</a>An Indiana Court of Appeals similarly overturned a TPR decision and accused the Department of Child Services of an <a href="http://www.theindianalawyer.com/coa-reverses-termination-of-parental-rights-finds-dcs-exhibited-troubling-behavior/PARAMS/article/42344" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"extraordinarily troubling pattern of behavior."</a> The case involved a mother who had fled an abusive relationship and completed every requirement set before her for unification, but who lost her son anyway.</p>
<p>The Vermont Supreme Court overturned a TRP order in Caledonia County at a time when "more children than ever are being taken into stat custody," according to the <a href="http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/story/news/crime/2016/12/16/vermont-high-court-reinstates-parents-rights/95515860/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Burlington Free Press</a>.</p>
<p>And in Connecticut a bill has been introduced to halt a <a href="http://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-custody-for-care-20170207-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"custody for care"</a> scheme (where the state won't provide care for children unless the parents give up custody) that the Department of Children and Families (DCF) denies even exists. According to the Hartford Courant,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Judicial department data show the state has used the petitions to take custody of more than 860 children over five years – or an average of three children a week.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Three children per week in a state the size of Connecticut is hardly a "last resort."</p>
<p>An <a href="http://www.theday.com/local/20170121/dcf-and-poor-is-system-fair" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">article at The Day</a> (also in Connecticut) reveals a system that <strong>often confuses poverty for neglect.</strong>
</p>
<p>A <a href="http://wspa.com/2016/12/31/terminating-parents-rights-on-the-rise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">report from KIMT</a> in Iowa in December similarly declared that <strong>"cases involving terminating the parents' rights to their children are on the rise."</strong>
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.fox26houston.com/news/203730609-story" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
<img src="http://parentalrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Screen-Shot-2017-02-15-at-4_10_10-PM-300x171.png">
</a>Other current concerns include a Texas case where child services workers had to be <a href="http://www.fox26houston.com/news/203730609-story" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sanctioned by a judge</a> for lying in court to illegally remove a child from her father. And in North Carolina, a young man <a href="http://photographyisnotacrime.com/2016/12/21/north-carolina-foster-child-sues-cps-supervisor-who-adopted-him-only-to-abuse-him/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sued the child services supervisor</a> "who adopted him, only for her and her boyfriend to spend several years abusing him."</p>
<p>
<strong>In short, parents are losing custody without cause in far too many cases </strong>– and often losing their permanent parental rights, as well. Yet the lack of a sound legal standard leaves the door open for judges and child welfare workers to continue the system as it is. <strong>The system is failing children, failing families, and failing our country as a whole.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<a id="disabilities" name="disabilities">
</a>••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••<br> <strong>Parental Rights and Parents with Disabilities</strong>
<br> <em>
<strong>General Direction: </strong>No real change, but growing awareness </em>
</p>
<p>Parents with disabilities have been left unprotected since the shameful <em>Buck v. Bell</em> Supreme Court decision of 1927. Because of that ruling, which allows states to "prevent those who are manifestly unfit from continuing their kind," 35 states today include disability as grounds for termination of parental rights. Ten states and the District of Columbia allow physical disability as the <em>sole grounds</em> for TPR – even without evidence of abuse or neglect[i].</p>
<p>It is perhaps no wonder, then, that Massachusetts was caught committing "extensive, ongoing violations" of the Americans with Disabilities Act in their removing of <a href="http://jezebel.com/a-mentally-disabled-mother-lost-her-newborn-and-fought-1754993385" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sara Gordon's baby</a> simply because Sara has a disability, according to a letter from the U.S. Department of Justice last year.</p>
<p>American society as a whole is no longer comfortable with the idea of taking children from parents with a disability simply because of their disability. We are outraged by stories like Sara's, or like that of the <a href="https://nfb.org/node/1047" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Missouri couple who lost their baby</a> in 2010 because both parents are blind. (Their baby was returned 57 days later, but valuable bonding and nursing time had been lost.) But to date the laws that would protect these parents have yet to be passed.</p>

<a id="solution" name="solution">
</a>•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••<br> <strong>Solution: The Parental Rights Amendment</strong>
</p>
<p>A proposed Parental Rights Amendment to the U.S. Constitution (PRA) would provide that "the liberty of parents to direct the upbringing, education, and care of their children is a fundamental right." By setting a firm constitutional standard to protect these rights, <strong>the Amendment would provide clear direction for courts, doctors, child welfare workers, and other government officials.</strong> Racial bias would diminish as fewer cases are left to the discretion of a judge or other state agent.</p>
<p>Another provision of the proposed Amendment would protect the rights of persons with disabilities so that mothers like Sara Gordon never lose their children in the first place. The proposal states, "The parental rights guaranteed by this article shall not be denied or abridged on account of disability."</p>
<p>The attack on parents in America continues. The PRA provides the single greatest means for parents to fight back – and win.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>On Tuesday, Feb. 14, President Jim Mason and Will Estrada <strong>visited the office of Rep. Trent Franks (R-AZ) </strong>to discuss the Parental Rights Amendment. Franks, who has long supported our effort (he was the lead sponsor of the Amendment, HJRes. 110, in 2012), is a member of the Constitution Subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee. This makes him a gate-keeper on the path the Amendment must take to get through the U.S. House.</p>
<p>
<strong>This was an exciting meeting among old friends as we worked to clear the path for passage of the Amendment.</strong>
</p>
<p>We also had an exciting meeting among some very new friends on Friday, February 10. While we are not yet at liberty to go into a lot of detail, <strong>family rights advocates from across the political spectrum met together to seek common ground and plan ways of working together to protect parental rights. </strong>These advocates came from all over the country, with the aim of reforming state or even federal law to keep children with their parents whenever possible (while still providing for the protection of children from abuse or neglect).</p>
<p>
<img src="http://parentalrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/coalition3.jpeg">
</p>
<p>We cannot name all the names, but our own Jim Mason, Jim Bentley, Will Estrada, and Martin Brown were in attendance.</p>
<p>We are hopeful the alliances formed in that meeting will <strong>help us reach across the aisle to promote the cause of parental rights for Americans of every political stripe.</strong>
</p>
<p>Please <a href="https://secure.parentalrights.org/np/clients/parentalrights/donation.jsp?campaign=5&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
<strong>consider a donation today</strong>
</a> to help us further this work as we gear up to make solid gains in this session of Congress.</p>
<p>Thank you for standing with us as we represent you in these vital meetings to further your rights in protecting your child.</p>

<p>
<strong>Report: Busy in the State House and in the U.S. Senate</strong>
</p>
<p>ParentalRights.org has been busy in the state house and in the U.S. Senate in recent weeks, working to pass parental rights legislation and see the Parental Rights Amendment introduced in the new Congress.</p>
<p>By mid-January, ParentalRights.org volunteers were <strong>working with lawmakers on active parental rights legislation in four states: Maine, Mississippi, Missouri, and Wyoming. </strong>As of this writing, three of those remain viable and two more efforts have been added to the list. Our effort in Mississippi, HC2, failed to clear the House Constitution Committee by the January 31 deadline and thereby failed. We will work with lawmakers there to try again next year.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Maine – </strong>Our effort in Maine, championed by Rep. Ellie Espling, has <strong>not yet received a bill number</strong> or been assigned to a committee.</li>
<li>
<strong>Missouri – </strong>In Missouri, <strong>
<a href="http://house.mo.gov/Bill.aspx?bill=HB354&amp;year=2017&amp;code=R" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HB 354</a> has been referred to the </strong>
<strong>House Judiciary Committee,</strong>but a hearing has not yet been scheduled. Nevertheless, lead sponsor Rep. Kurt Bahr and our state volunteer Jill Johnson have already been making visits to the Missouri Senate to prepare for when the bill arrives there after a successful House vote. Bahr and Johnson got together on February 2 to meet with key Senate targets on what Johnson called a “short by exciting, fruitful day.”</li>
<li>
<strong>Wyoming – </strong>Unlike Missouri, whose legislature won’t adjourn until the end of May, Wyoming’s legislature will adjourn in March. That means bills there have to move much more quickly. Fortunately, <a href="https://openstates.org/wy/bills/2017/HB153/">HB 153</a> on Parental Rights is doing just that. Approved by the House Development Committee (9-0) on January 23, <strong>the bill was adopted by the full House </strong>(50-7, 3 excused) four days later (Jan. 27).By February 3, it had been<strong> transferred to the Senate</strong> and assigned to the Senate Judiciary Committee.To Wyoming state coordinator Jan Loftus, that was terrific news. “I think we have a good chance of passing there [Judiciary],” Loftus commented in an email. “Praise God. There were a couple of committees [it could have gone to] that looked very unlikely.”</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to these efforts, we have added support for bills in Alaska and New York, though those are not our typical parental rights-defining legislation.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Alaska – </strong>Alaska’s <a href="https://legiscan.com/AK/bill/HB10/2017" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HB 10</a> seeks to bring all of Alaska child removal cases into line with the stricter standards of the federal Indian Child Welfare Protection Act 1978 (ICWA),regardless of whether the child involved is of tribal descent or not. As a result, the state could no longer remove children from their parents without showing “(1) by a preponderance of the evidence, removal of the child is necessary to prevent imminent physical damage or harm to the child, or (2) by clear and convincing evidence…the child would likely suffer serious physical or emotional damage if left in the child’s home.”This heightened evidence requirement<strong>should result in fewer children being removed without cause from non-abusive homes.</strong>As a result, ParentalRights.org supports this bill.</li>
<li>
<strong>New York – </strong>And in New York, Assemblywoman Carrie Woerner (D-113) is preparing to introduce legislation that will <strong>tighten the instances when grandparents can sue for child visitation under that state’s grandparent visitation statute. </strong>The bill, which we have reviewed, would also provide a means for parents to recoup their court costs from the grandparents in the event the visitation is denied. These steps will protect parents from being beggared by repeated frivolous attempts to disrupt their healthy family.While this bill is a long way from establishing parental rights as fundamental and protected, it is a solid step in a positive direction in a state that has not traditionally been favorable to parents. <strong>For these reasons, we support this bill as well.</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>National Efforts</strong>
<br>
Meanwhile, new ParentalRights.org President Jim Mason joined Government Relations Director Will Estrada on Capitol Hill last Thursday to meet with <strong>key Senators</strong> about the proposed Parental Rights Amendment.They met up with our outreach coordinator Melissa Ortiz to visit the offices of several key Senators, including members of the Senate leadership, to pitch the proposed Parental Rights Amendment (PRA). They also took the opportunity to <strong>meet with roughly 50 other organizations near the Capitol</strong> to educate them on this important issue. Meanwhile, Community Liaison Martin Brown met with the staff of a key House lawmaker, also to pitch the PRA.</p>
<p>Though the Senate is currently swamped with confirmation hearings, our allies there give us every confidence <strong>we will see the PRA re-introduced </strong>early in this session, perhaps by the beginning of March.</p>

<p>
<strong>Going Deeper: Two-Thirds Vote Needed to Pass the Parental Rights Amendment</strong>
</p>
<p>To see the Parental Rights Amendment adopted, <strong>we need a two-thirds vote in both houses of Congress, followed by a majority vote in the legislatures of three fourths (38) of the states. </strong>And it all starts with filing a “concurrent resolution” in Congress.</p>
<p>A concurrent resolution is one designed to be taken up in both houses at the same time, so a House concurrent resolution will presumably be accompanied by a matching Senate concurring resolution. We are already in talks with lawmakers in both chambers and on both sides of the aisle, with the aim of introducing a bipartisan measure in each house.</p>
<p>Once a resolution is introduced, it is assigned to the appropriate (House or Senate) Judiciary Committee, who will generally then assign it to the Subcommittee on the Constitution. From there, the first step is generally a subcommittee hearing, followed by a vote of the subcommittee. If the resolution passes the subcommittee, it then goes to the full Committee on the Judiciary. A majority vote there is sufficient to send the resolution to the floor of the House or of the Senate.</p>
<p>On the floor of each house, the Amendment must receive a two-thirds vote. That means 68 senators and 290 representatives. This is important to note: because of this two-thirds requirement, adoption of the PRA absolutely must be a bipartisan effort. If the current majority party chose to go it alone, the Amendment would come up 16 votes short in the Senate and 50 votes shy in the House. And that’s if every Republican voted for the measure!</p>
<p>This is why spanning the aisle is so important. And that’s why our representatives on Capitol Hill last week were meeting with lawmakers from both sides of the aisle to get on record in supporting parental rights.</p>
<p>
<strong>Only together can we protect children by empowering all parents through the Parental Rights Amendment.</strong>

<p>
<strong>Report: Mom Shocked When School Pulled Son’s Teeth</strong>
</p>
<p>According to a <a href="http://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2017/01/20/mom-outraged-school-dental-program-removes-childs-teeth-without-her-knowing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 20 news report from Baltimore CBS affiliate WJZ</a>, mother Shanda Fleming was shocked and outraged when her son Michael came home from school missing three teeth. <strong>A dental program visiting his school had removed the teeth and sent him home with no medicine – without notifying his mother. </strong>Even worse, he came home late and on foot, because the procedure caused him to miss the bus. An effective way to treat teeth would have been to do some <a href="https://holistickenko.com/oil-pulling-holistic-oral-care/">oil pulling</a>. </p>
<p>“He walked home alone after having three teeth extracted from his mouth. He could have fell out or anything,” Fleming told WJZ.</p>
<p>Such school dental programs apparently have become commonplace in Maryland since a child died from an infected tooth in 2007. But protecting children doesn’t involve cutting parents out of key health decisions.</p>
<p>Fleming recalls signing a permission form regarding the dental clinic, but insists she thought it was just for a routine cleaning. “They just said they was gonna clean my teeth,” Michael insists.</p>
<p>To be balanced and fair, it is possible, depending on what the form said, that Fleming’s rights were not violated when the teeth were pulled. We do not have access to the form to know what it said, and we must acknowledge the possibility that she signed consent for the extractions.</p>
<p>But even that would not excuse the school from letting him walk home alone afterwards. <strong>A single phone call to a concerned parent seems a small price to pay to protect a third-grade boy in that situation.</strong>
</p>
<p>“I just don’t understand how a school or a company can take it in their hands to do something like this to a child,” Fleming said.</p>
<p>While the proposed <a href="https://parentalrights.org/amendment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Parental Rights Amendment</a> cannot instantly cure in detail every parental rights violation, <strong>its passage will communicate and demand a deeper respect for parents by educators and clinicians alike. </strong>The PRA’s provision that “[t]he liberty of parents to direct the upbringing, education, and care of their child is a fundamental right” would inform schools like this one in Baltimore when they are deciding how they will work with parents in these events.</p>
<p>And it will give parents solid legal ground to stand on in court if they have to defend against their rights being taken away.</p>
<p>If the school in this case had spoken with the mom, she could have told them about the appointment Michael already had set with his own dentist for January 23. Perhaps then his teeth could have been pulled in a safer environment, by a dentist aware of the boy’s full medical and dental history.</p>
<p>And certainly the boy would have had a safe ride home.</p>

<p>•••••••••••••••••••••••••</p>
<p>
<strong>Going Deeper: HIPAA</strong>
</p>
<p>HIPPA – the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 – is a federal law designed to protect the privacy of patients. It instructs doctors, dentists, and insurance companies in how to respect and protect your medical or dental records.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, HIPAA is intentionally vague to work effectively with related state laws. Even more unfortunate, <strong>insurance companies and professional associations have stepped up to try to fill in some of the details in ways that will best serve themselves, and not necessarily the patient or parents.</strong>
</p>
<p>In the Baltimore case featured above, for instance, <strong>the school cited HIPAA when it declined to answer questions for WJZ, </strong>as though HIPAA were designed to protect the school. HIPAA is often misused by child welfare service organizations the same way: “We can’t comment on that case because it would violate HIPAA,” even if the family are the ones asking them to comment.</p>
<p>HIPAA is designed to protect the privacy of the patient and family, not to hide the workings of a public agency.</p>
<p>State laws vary on when a child can make his own medical decisions. It is not uncommon for state laws to allow children as young as 12-14 to make their own decisions in areas of sexuality, drug and alcohol use, and mental health (particularly depression) in an attempt to encourage young people to seek the medical help they need, even if they’re afraid of what their parents might say or do.</p>
<p>
<strong>HIPAA is designed to allow for these state laws.</strong> So it protects the privacy of a minor against the parents in the event that state law permits this and that the doctor believes such privacy to be necessary for the health of the minor. Your 15-year-old’s flu shot records? They wouldn’t be kept from you under HIPAA.</p>
<p>
<strong>But insurance companies want efficiency, and to that end “one size fits all” works best.</strong> That’s why so many doctors’ offices won’t let you access your minor’s records online, and won’t share them with you at all without your child’s consent.It’s simpler for them to hide the whole record from you than to hide only those parts where a minor may have a legal right to individual privacy from mom and dad.</p>
<p>For the insurance company, the greater risk is that a minor may sue for privacy violations than that a parent may sue to see an inappropriately hidden record. If the parent wins, the records are handed over. If the minor wins, the doctor could shell out millions in “damages.”</p>
<p>No state law that we are aware of protects a privacy right of a minor against his or her parents regarding dental care. That means HIPAA keeps your dentist from sharing your child’s information with anyone else – a nosey reporter or teacher, for instance – but it does not keep them from sharing that record with you.</p>
<p>If your doctor or dentist doesn’t understand this, though, try to go easy on them. They didn’t dream this up on their own to shut you out. <strong>They’re probably just doing what their malpractice insurance company has told them they have to do. </strong>HIPAA can be vague, and doctors are left in a tight spot.</p>
<p>
<strong>As parents come to better understand HIPAA, and share this information in a helpful way with their doctor or dentist, </strong>perhaps we can find common sense ways for these professionals to keep those parents in the loop.</p>
<p>And the proposed <a href="https://parentalrights.org/amendment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Parental Rights Amendment</a> may give health professionals the incentive they need to apply HIPAA as it was intended, and not as best suits the insurance companies.</p>

<strong>Report: Parental Rights Foundation Shares Report on Medical Ethics in Abuse Investigations</strong>
</p>
<p>The Parental Rights Foundation is excited to share another scholarly article on the tragic loss of parental rights in the medical setting through physical child abuse investigations. The paper, by George Barry and Diane Redleaf of the Family Defense Center in Chicago, points out <strong>disturbing medical ethics violations in the subspecialty field of child abuse pediatrics.</strong> (See the <a href="#deeper">Going Deeper section of this email</a> for more on the paper’s content.)</p>
<p>We have been privileged to sit down and talk with Diane Redleaf on multiple occasions in recent months, both about her work in the Chicago area and about ways our organization can partner with hers to protect children by empowering parents caught up in the child welfare system. We are excited to work with her, honored to share her paper with you, and looking forward to getting a lot done in cooperation with her in the months and years ahead.</p>
<p>Through her work, Redleaf has developed a number of professional and organizational contacts that are traditionally on the left side of the political aisle. ParentalRights.org, through the nature of its founding, started out with similar contacts on the right side of the aisle. <strong>We look forward to working with Redleaf and other of her colleagues to erase the aisle altogether as we work to defend families, regardless of political persuasion.</strong>

<p>
<strong>Going Deeper: “Medical Ethics Concerns” in Review</strong>
</p>
<p>Writing for the Family Defense Center in Chicago, George J. Barry and Diane L. Redleaf published their criticism of the sub-specialty of child abuse pediatrics. In studying the day-to-day practices of the profession, Barry and Redleaf found that more often than not the “experts” violate several core principles adopted and recognized by the American Medical Association Code of Ethics and the Committee on Child Abuse and Neglect of the American Academy of Pediatrics.</p>
<p>“We submit, in this Paper,” reads the executive summary, “that <strong>this system of child abuse investigation and medical assessment is failing the children and families.</strong> We also submit that the failings are due at least in part to practices that are ethically questionable at best or plainly unethical at worst…. [W]e believe that the medical profession has turned a blind eye to the treatment of children and families who are the victims of misplaced child abuse allegations and we are concerned about developments in the handling of medically complex allegations that make these problems worse, not better.”</p>
<p>The paper does not look so much at the legality of these new practices – how they compare to the dictates of law – as at the question of whether they are ethical – how they comport with “medical ethics” as declared and adopted by respected medical associations.</p>
<p>Redleaf, who is a 1979 graduate of Stanford Law School and the legal director of the Family Defense Center, drew upon her experiences defending actual parents in family court, in part by including 5 real-life case studies in her paper.</p>
<p>“In the typical Family Defense Center medically complex case,” she summarizes, <strong>“parents are eventually exonerated and children are returned home, but only after intervention by the child protection system that lasted weeks, months, or even years.”</strong> That intrusion, the paper holds, causes permanent damage to the entire family.</p>
<p>“In the spirit of ‘first do no harm,’” the authors conclude in part, “the medical profession should recognize when its practices cause harm and should work to mitigate that harm whenever possible.”</p>
<p>Barry and Redleaf also argue that child abuse specialists who interview parents for primarily forensic (evidence-gathering) reasons and not medical reasons violate the principle that doctors are ethically prohibited from participating in interrogations.</p>
<p>These and other concerns fill the 114 pages of the review, which is well worth the read to parents caught in the cross hairs of a failing system, and to doctors troubled by the ethically-questionable direction their profession has taken in recent years.</p>
<p>You can read the paper in its entirety at the <a href="http://parentalrightsfoundation.org/medical_ethics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Parental Rights Foundation here</a>.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>
<strong>Wyoming House Bill 153 (<a href="https://openstates.org/wy/bills/2017/HB153/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HB153</a>) cleared its first committee hurdle yesterday, January 23, by a vote of 9-0.</strong> The bill, which would preserve “the liberty of parents to direct the upbringing, education, and care of their children [as] a fundamental right,” was referred to the House Minerals, Business, and Economic Development Committee on January 19, probably due to a backlog of bills in other committees. Given the quick turn around and the successful vote, we are certainly not complaining.</p>
<p>Rep. Mark Jennings (R-30) is the first of 19 sponsors listed on the bill, which is <strong>already on the schedule for First Reading in the full House (“Committee of the Whole”). </strong>It is pretty far down the list, so while it could conceivably be voted on in that body today, tomorrow is perhaps more likely.</p>
<p>HB 153 would add to Wyoming law that “The state, or any agency or political subdivision of the state, shall not infringe the parental right as provided under this section without demonstrating that the interest of the government as applied to the person or child is a compelling state interest addressed by the least restrictive means.” This language would clearly establish “strict scrutiny” as the proper standard of review in parental rights cases — the same high standard of review called for in the proposed Parental Rights Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.</p>
<p>
<strong>No action is called for at this time.</strong> We will keep you posted in case calls are warranted to move the bill at any point in the future.</p>
<p>Thank you for standing with us to protect children by protecting the rights of parents in Wyoming law!</p>

<![CDATA[<p>“Let’s get Jim Mason in here to discuss this.” In the eight years I’ve served at ParentalRights.org, I don’t know how many times a discussion on strategy or legal language included Mike Farris saying those words. In a meeting of the ParentalRights.org board on January 9, it’s as though Mike made the suggestion one more time.</p>
<p>In response, the board elected Jim Mason to succeed Farris as the president of ParentalRights.org.</p>
<p>Mason, father of 7 and a 15-year member of the legal staff at the Homeschool Legal Defense Association that Farris founded in 1983, was named HSLDA’s vice president of litigation in 2016. He has experience in defending parental rights around the country, including before the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Significantly, Mason was in discussions with Mike Farris on ParentalRights.org from its founding and even before. <strong>“I was there when the organization was a ‘notes on a napkin’ idea with Mike Farris and (PRO board member) Mike Smith,” Mason asserts. “We worked out the initial amendment language together.”</strong>
</p>
<p>Mason has been an officer of the organization since its inception, serving as the secretary of the ParentalRights.org board prior to his election as president.</p>
<p>So though his name may not be familiar to you now, he is no newcomer to ParentalRights.org or to our mission.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Dear Parental Rights Oklahoma Supporter,</p>
<p>It’s hard to believe that Oklahoma’s Legislative session 2017 will begin in a little over two weeks, but it is upon us and there are several pieces of legislation being introduced that are particularly concerning to us at Parentalrights.org.</p>
<p>
<strong>Concerning Bills</strong>
</p>
<p>The first bill I want to bring to your attention is <a href="http://webserver1.lsb.state.ok.us/cf_pdf/2017-18%20INT/SB/SB83%20INT.PDF" target="_blank">SB83</a> by Senator Yen. <strong>SB83 removes both the religious and philosophical exemptions for vaccinations.</strong> The bill would require a medical exemption from your doctor if you do not want to have your child given any one of the 69 “required” vaccines.</p>
<p>
<strong>Whether you vaccinate your child or not you should be concerned with this statist legislation.</strong> If the state can force a medical procedure against a parent’s wishes, the medical principle of “informed consent” is violated and a child is left to the whims of the government. This bill is a MUST STOP!!</p>
<p>Of course, this topic deserves much more information than is given here. So, if you would like to know more, I will be posting information on our web site at <a href="http://www.okpbr.org/" target="_blank">www.okpbr.org</a> or our Facebook page <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ParentalRightsOK/" target="_blank">Parental Rights Oklahoma</a>.</p>
<p>Another bill that will need our attention is <a href="http://webserver1.lsb.state.ok.us/cf_pdf/2017-18%20INT/SB/SB93%20INT.PDF" target="_blank">SB93</a> by Senator Smalley. SB93 amends Title 10A OK Juvenile Justice Code and <strong>would allow a judge to examine the religious beliefs and practices of the parent, legal guardian, or custodian</strong> when determining the appropriate conditions for the release of a child in Department of Human Services (DHS) custody. We are concerned that if a judge did not approve of the religious beliefs of the parent, he could set conditions on the return of the children that would violate the family’s convictions.</p>
<p>SB 93 would also impose a new requirement when a child was removed by DHS and was in need of medical treatment. If the parent, legal guardian, or custodian in such a case “depends upon spiritual means alone, in accordance with the tenets and practices of a recognized church or religious denomination, for the treatment, cure of disease or remedial care of such child,” then the court would be required by law to appoint a guardian for the child.</p>
<p>If the bill passes, it will be the first time in Oklahoma history that judges would be granted this level of authority to rule over a parent’s religious beliefs.</p>
<p>There are certainly other bills that will require our attention in 2017, but these are particularly worrisome. They will require significant effort on our part to ensure that they are defeated so Oklahoma continues to protect the rights of parents.</p>
<p>
<strong>Action Needed</strong>
</p>
<p>And that brings me to the reason I am writing this email: I NEED YOUR HELP!</p>
<p>Parental rights are under a coordinated and concerted attack this year and PRO needs volunteers to help us fight against bills like these. If you are interested in helping with lobbying, social media, or with our website, please contact me at <a href="mailto:parentalrights.ok@gmail.com">parentalrights.ok@gmail.com</a>.</p>
<p>
<strong>I will be at the Capitol each week, and would be happy to train any volunteers that would like to learn how to become a citizen lobbyist.</strong> Let’s just say, if I can do it anyone can! It is one of the most impactful ways that a citizen can participate in their government.</p>
<p>
<strong>If you would rather work behind the scenes, then consider helping us with social media or the website. </strong>They are very important in today’s culture. Social media is a powerful tool to educate and inform our supporters, but it requires a bit of work to maintain the messaging needed to be successful. We can use more than one person for each of these jobs; if several step up to help there will not be much work for any one person to do.</p>
<p>Please do not assume that someone else will volunteer. If you think you can help, please volunteer today.</p>
<p>I look forward to hearing from each of you soon,</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Tracey Montgomery<br>
Oklahoma State Coordinator</p>

<![CDATA[<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE // January 10, 2017 // Purcellville, VA – This afternoon <strong>ParentalRights.org founder Michael Farris announced he is stepping down as president of the national organization</strong> promoting the Parental Rights Amendment. Farris is concurrently leaving his 30-year employment with the Homeschool Legal Defense Association to accept a position as president, CEO, and General Counsel of the Alliance Defending Freedom. (Farris will continue as chairman of the HSLDA board.)</p>
<p>“For over thirty years I have worked hard to defend both religious freedom and parental rights,” Farris said in a statement. “I view these rights as inextricably bound and truly essential for freedom. The opportunity to lead the largest organization in the world that protects religious freedom was a door that appeared to me to be opened by God for this season of my life.”</p>
<p>Farris commented that his former organizations and his new venture share a common cause for parents.</p>
<p>“Alliance Defending Freedom has long worked to support parental rights—especially in homeschooling cases in Europe, but in American courts as well,” Farris explained.</p>
<p>While Farris’s departure will necessarily lead to changes at ParentalRights.org, <strong>his legacy will grow as the organization continues the mission he set from the start.</strong>
</p>
<p>“Our goal remains the same,” says ParentalRights.org Executive Director Jim Bentley of the change. “Our commitment to protect children by empowering parents through passage of good parental rights law, and especially through adoption of the Parental Rights Amendment, is unwavering.”</p>
<p>Farris agrees.</p>
<p>
<strong>“I am not leaving the team or the cause,” </strong>Farris assures organization supporters. “I am just changing seats on the bus so that I can better advance our fundamental freedoms. Please help ParentalRights.org continue this vital work.”</p>
<p>[End release]</p>
<p>Those who wish to support Farris’s legacy financially are encouraged to <a href="https://secure.parentalrights.org/np/clients/parentalrights/donation.jsp?campaign=5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">do so here</a>. Regardless, we are thankful to you for standing with us as we continue the course to preserve parental rights.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>California is at it again. Last year, California passed the notorious SB 277, removing all non-medical vaccination exemptions, and undermining the fundamental right of parents to direct the medical care of their children. <strong>Apparently, that was <em>not enough</em>.</strong>
</p>
<p>SB18, filed in December, would plot a dangerous new course for the legislature regarding parental rights. The lawmakers could decide and/or delegate to bureaucrats what decisions are “optimal,” “healthy,” “appropriate, quality,” and “research-based.” This would remove the legal presumption that “natural bonds of affection lead <em>parents</em> to act in the best interests of their children.” <em>Parham v. J.R.</em>, 442 U.S. 584 (1979), emphasis added.</p>
<p>If California gets their way, <strong>the whole notion that parents know and love their children best will be replaced by a system where the government gets to decide what’s best for children</strong> without a showing of need to intervene into a parent’s  child-rearing decisions. This is not in the best interest of children and families, and we must not let it happen.</p>
<p>From the beginning, our goal has been to protect family privacy and the vital parent-child relationship, except where evidence of abuse or neglect exists. We cannot meet that goal while letting California run roughshod over families. But we need your help to meet this challenge.</p>
<p>Please <strong>take a moment right now – before you close this email – to make your <a href="https://secure.parentalrights.org/donation.jsp?campaign=5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">best possible donation</a> to ParentalRights.org</strong> today to empower us to stand against this menace to parental rights. If this intrusion into the family becomes a reality in California, it won’t be long before this push will reach your state. The time to act is now, but we can only stand with your support.</p>
<p>If you cannot give today, we would welcome your prayers and urge you to continue to follow our emails to stay informed of threats like this in your own state. But if you can give, please know <a href="https://secure.parentalrights.org/donation.jsp?campaign=5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">your gift today</a> <strong>will help protect children</strong> by empowering their parents against the unjustified government intrusion we’re seeing in California as we speak.</p>
<p>Thank you for standing with us to support parental rights.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Michael P. Farris, J.D, LL.M.<br>
President</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Please contact your Idaho senator today to support <a href="https://www.legislature.idaho.gov/legislation/2016/S1293.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">S 1293</a>, a Senate bill that gives parents whose children attend public schools a meaningful amount of leverage when they ask a public school to treat their child a bit differently than others. This innovative bill is truly a leap forward in getting public schools to provide an education that is tailored appropriately to the individual student.</p>
<p>Public schools are known for a rigidly standardized education. While current law gives disabled students a right to “reasonable accommodations,” and gives students with learning disabilities a right to an “individualized education plan,” students whose genuine unique needs don’t neatly fit into those two categories are left to “sink or swim.” It’s a brutal system, but S 1293 sponsor Senator Mary Souza has the courage to challenge it.</p>
<p>
<strong>In effect, S 1293 gives every student the right to have their own legitimate needs met (with some reasonable limitations). </strong>Public schools must use their “best efforts” to meet those needs. That’s a huge step forward.</p>
<p>In the past, if a parent wanted to bring about change in an unresponsive public school, his or her only meaningful options were to try to change the composition of their school board or get the superintendent replaced. Getting either of those done tended to be long, slow, difficult and uncertain. S 1293 will be a powerful engine for improvement in the public schools.</p>
<p>Most parents will never need or request an accommodation. Of those who do, not every request will be granted. But many will. And perhaps in the long run public schools will begin to look at students differently.</p>
<p>This bill originally contained language that could call into question the “fundamental parental rights” standard set by a new law last year, but Sen. Souza listened to our concerns and has amended the bill to remove that confusion. <strong>As amended, this bill represents a wonderful step forward for parents in the public school community.</strong>
</p>
<p>If your children are home-schooled or attend private school, this bill as amended will not affect you directly. But by preserving the rights of public school parents to speak into their child’s education, we also shape the kind of citizens who will be leading our institutions and organizations in the coming years. <strong>In addition, promoting respect for parental rights in one area strengthens parental rights in other areas too. </strong>In these ways this bill affects everyone.</p>
<p>So please take a moment right now to contact your state senator and ask him or her to support the bill. Your message can be as simple as, “Please support S 1293 as amended. With the amendment, it is an excellent bill that gives parents a meaningful voice when they ask a public school to accommodate their child’s needs with the best quality education for that individual.”</p>
<p>You can find contact info for and identify your senator using <a href="https://legislature.idaho.gov/who%27smylegislator.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this page</a>, or if you already know your lawmaker’s name you can find contact info on the <a href="http://legislature.idaho.gov/senate/membership.cfm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Senate directory here</a>.</p>
<p>Thank you for taking a moment to make your voice heard for the rights of parents with students in Idaho’s public schools.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

Director of Communications &amp; Research</p>

<![CDATA[<p>[Edited 5/31/17 to remove expired links]</p>
<p>Dear Champion of Parental Rights,</p>
<p>You scored a minor victory for parental rights in New Jersey on Monday, and there’s a good chance you didn’t even know it. On January 11, the New Jersey Senate voted to adopt the proposed changes to <a href="http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2014/Bills/A3500/3435_R2.PDF" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A3435</a>, which the governor provisionally vetoed in November.</p>
<p>We learned last June about A3435, a bill that <strong>would allow children of any age to grant legal consent for behavioral and mental health care</strong> – without even consulting a parent. But it had almost slipped past us. We became aware of the bill very late in the session. [<strong>Ed. note</strong>: We originally said “on the last day,” but we actually learned of the bill in the final 2 weeks or so before its passage.]</p>
<p>It was too late to block this assault on parents and children in the legislature, so we penned a strong letter to Governor Christie and asked you to call him as well. Other allied organizations joined us as well. Together we urged him to veto the measure.</p>
<p>And the governor listened.</p>
<p>Governor Christie sent the bill back to the legislature demanding that they make three major changes to the bill, or he would veto it. The changes he stipulated were: (1) it would apply only to children age 16 or older; (2) it could not be used to prescribe medication; and (3) it would apply only to outpatient treatment.</p>
<p>A3435 is not a parental rights-friendly bill, and <strong>we would have liked to see a full veto. But with these changes, the bill’s impact on parental rights is greatly reduced.</strong> Protecting children by keeping parents involved in prescriptions and patient in-take decisions, as well as setting the minimum age requirement for minor-consent at 16 (rather than the original, which was literally <em>no limit at all!</em>), are huge improvements.</p>
<p>To be clear, lowering the age of consent for behavioral and mental health from 18 to 16 is a rejection of parental rights in that two-year window. We are still opposed to this move, and would like to see it repealed in the future.</p>
<p>But given that the original bill passed by a veto-proof majority in both houses, <strong>it is amazing that both bodies agreed to consider the governor’s changes</strong> at all. They had the votes to push back with the original version and win.</p>
<p>Instead, the Assembly voted (52-10) on December 3 to adopt an amended version of A3435 with the governor’s recommendations. The Senate voted (36-0) to approve the changes on Monday.</p>
<p>
<strong>In the face of the original bill, seeing these changes approved is a significant victory for parental rights – one you fought for in June and finally received this week.</strong>
</p>
<p>Thank you for answering the call and standing with us to protect children by defending parental rights in your state!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Dear Champion of Parental Rights in Connecticut,</p>
<p>In recent months, bills have been passed or introduced in several states, including California, New York, and North Carolina, that would remove all exemptions from the government-mandated vaccination schedule except in a few specific medical cases. <strong>This removes from parents the fundamental right to make the best informed medical decision for their individual child.</strong>
</p>
<p>The Connecticut Coalition for Vaccine Choice was formed to defend doctors, parents, and children against the encroachment of such heavy-handed laws coming to your state. Now they would like your input and help.</p>
<p>
<strong>The Coalition is hosting a meeting at 7 p.m. on Tuesday, January 12, in Fairfield</strong> to discuss the issue and make plans for educating legislators to make the right choices when they vote. You can <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/MANDATORY_VACCINES_FLYER-V.4-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">see their flyer with all the details here.</a>
</p>
<p>ParentalRights.org is not a medical organization and does not have a position on the safety or efficacy of any one vaccine or of vaccines in general. We simply stand by the timeless legal principle that parents are in the best position (until proven otherwise through due process) to make medical decisions for their child; the government is not. Laws that remove a parent’s choice in these situations violate the fundamental constitutional right of parents to direct the upbringing and care of their children.</p>
<p>If you are able to join our allies for this planning meeting on Tuesday, we would encourage you to do so. Thank you for standing with us to protect children by empowering parents through actions like these.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>[Updated 6/6/17]</p>
<p>Perhaps this has happened to you. You walk into the doctor’s or the dentist’s office and you find a sign like the one shown at right. “Parents: Due to new HIPAA and OSHA regulations you are not permitted beyond this point!”</p>
<p>What can you do? And what <em>should</em> you do?</p>
<p>For many, the first response is disbelief, followed by anger. Maybe you’re thinking, as a commenter on our Facebook post of this weekend did, “Whole lotta NOPE going on right here!” But <strong>the best response is generally to talk with the staff</strong>.</p>
<p>Some practices really do fail to respect the special role parents play in a young patient’s life. But most professionals understand and appreciate what parents bring to the table. (And as another commented, it is often not the doctor but overreaching government that is pushing them to “police” you anyway. The doctor may well be on your side!)</p>
<p>So <strong>start with a practice you trust</strong>. If you are new to an area, ask around. Go in and “interview” the office. Learn their reputation. Then, as one dental professional suggested, go yourself before you take your child. Were you comfortable enough with them when they cleaned your teeth to let them work on your child as well? (Obviously this advice is of no use in the emergency room, but great for the dentist or family doctor.)</p>
<p>You might assume, as many did when we posted this picture (and as we did ourselves) that the dentist is claiming falsely that new HIPAA guidelines require them to separate parent from child to protect the child’s privacy. What we learned from the West Virginia dentist’s office where this picture was taken, however, was that their office’s open floor plan forces them to balance parental rights against the privacy of <em>the person in the next bay over</em>. Parents, however, are always included in their child’s exam and all decision making. When they saw how their sign was misunderstood, they quickly took it down, and they have assured us that they respect the role of parents with their children.</p>
<p>In the case of <a href="http://www.ijreview.com/2014/06/144923-one-mom-hospital-tries-pull-daughter-aside-private-conversation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Michigan mother Christy Duffy</a> two months ago, it took a public outcry to drive the hospital to back away from its posted policy. In this current case, all it took was a conversation. (The practice also received a good deal of heat from our post, but that proved to be unnecessary.)</p>
<p>So talk to your doctor or dentist. <strong>If you see a sign like this one, ask them about it.</strong> If it is truly their intention to stand between you and your child, find a new doctor. If it is not, you might graciously suggest they fix their sign. Either way, both your children and our cause will be served best by a polite and civil discourse for as long as that is possible.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Since its introduction in 2008, the Common Core State Standards Initiative, or “Common Core” (CCSSI) has been touted as a “voluntary, state led” initiative to adopt a common set of academic standards for all states in the country. As it turns out, <strong>the development of Common Core was not state-led</strong>, and participation, while technically voluntary, was very strongly coerced.</p>
<p>Our research into the standards themselves is ongoing, but frankly that is a secondary concern. ParentalRights.org stands opposed to the process by which Common Core has come to be. <strong>Its creation and administration have violated constitutional principles and rob parents of the right to oversee the education of their children.</strong>
</p>
<h2>
<strong>Common Core: Private Roots</strong>
</h2>
<p>In 2007, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Eli Broad Foundation pledged $60 million dollars into a campaign to infuse education into the 2008 political race<sup>i</sup>. In May, 2008, the Gates Foundation awarded a $2.2 million grant to the Hunt Institute for Educational Leadership and Policy<sup>ii</sup> which, one month later, hosted a symposium alongside the National Governors Association (NGA) on education strategies.</p>
<p>Later the same year, NGA and the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO) began accepting federal grants with which to launch Common Core. In December, 2008, NGA, CCSSO and Achieve – their contractor in Washington, D.C. – laid out a vision for Common Core standards in a document called <em>Benchmarking for Success</em>. This report, like so much of the process leading to it, was funded by the Gates Foundation<sup>iii</sup>, and it was given to the Obama administration as part of his transition to the White House.</p>
<p>According to a 2012 white paper from the Pioneer Institute and the American Principles Project (upon which this article is based), “Through 2008, <strong>the Common Core Initiative was a plan of private groups being implemented through trade associations, albeit trade associations that have ‘official’-sounding names.</strong> Since 2007, NGA, CCSSO, and Achieve accepted more than $27 million from the Gates Foundation alone to advance the Standards and the connected data-collection and assessments.”<sup>iv</sup>
</p>
<p>To this day, “<strong>the Standards are owned and copyrighted by nongovernmental entities unaccountable to parents</strong> and students in the individual states.”<sup>v</sup>
</p>
<h2>
<strong>Common Core: Federal Coercion</strong>
</h2>
<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (or “Stimulus Bill”) was enacted on February 17, 2009, and provided the next key component in the drive toward Common Core. Through this bill Congress earmarked $4.35 billion for states that make “significant progress” toward four education-reform objectives.</p>
<p>One week after the bill was passed, Secretary of Education Arne Duncan rolled out the federal “Race to the Top” program through the Department of Education (DOE). In a C-SPAN interview, Secretary Duncan explained, “We want to get into this game…. There are great outside partners – Achieve, the Gates Foundation, others – who are providing great leadership…. I want to be the one to help it come to fruition.”<sup>vi</sup>
</p>
<p>From there, the timing was telling<sup>vii</sup>:</p>
<p>In March, 2009, the DOE announced that “Race to the Top” funding would be rewarded through two rounds of competitive grants.</p>
<p>On June 1, NGA and CCSSO officially launched their Common Core Standards Initiative.</p>
<p>“Race to the Top” required states to commit to a common set of K-12 standards by August 2, 2009 – at which time the newly-launched “Common Core” was the only such effort in existence. <strong>States that did not commit to the program stood no chance of winning any of the grant money.</strong>
</p>
<p>Phase I applications were invited in November, 2009, with a due date of January 19, 2010. <strong>“[A]pplicant states were required to demonstrate their commitment to Common Core without having seen even a draft of the standards.”</strong>
</p>
<p>On February 22, President Obama in a speech revealed his intent to tie all Title I funding to this same Common Core commitment, essentially cutting off nearly all federal education funding to states that opt out. A March, 2010, DOE report stated that this cut off would occur by 2015.</p>
<p>In March of 2010, two months after applications had been received committing states to the standards, the first draft of Common Core was finally released by NGA and CCSSO.</p>
<p>Phase 2 applications were due June 1 of 2010, and the final draft of Common Core was not released until the following day. Applicants of both phases committed to the standards without even knowing what they would be.</p>
<p>What is more, the Race to the Top application stipulates that states must adopt and implement Common Core word for word. They can add to it only provided the additions do not amount to more than 15% of the material taught, but they cannot take away from it by any means.</p>
<h2>
<strong>Common Core: Conclusion</strong>
</h2>
<p>In short, far from being state-led, Common Core was developed in such a way as to keep the states completely in the dark. <strong>It was created and is still owned and copyrighted by private organizations with no accountability to the parents or students of any state.</strong> Neither are they accountable to the states themselves. The federal government used tax-payer monies to coerce the states into adopting the standards sight-unseen, contrary to the interests of the tax-payers.</p>
<p>While proponents advertised Common Core as a “voluntary, state-led” initiative, the states have been following blindly from the start. <strong>Not one citizen-elected legislative body has had any input into the standards or the system of development by which those standards came to be.</strong>
</p>
<h2>
<strong>What Is To Be Done About Common Core?</strong>
</h2>
<p>This initiative clearly violates the right of parents to direct the education of their children. As the Pioneer Institute’s report points out, <strong>“If the states no longer have control over education, neither can the parents in those states.” </strong>“The best way to stop this scheme,” the paper also asserts, “is for the individual states to refuse to participate.”</p>
<p>We will continue to push forward, first with our efforts to pass the Parental Rights Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. This amendment will defend the fundamental right of parents to direct the education of their children.</p>
<p>We will also continue to shine light on this devious power grab. The more who know what is going on, the stronger the voice that will rise up to oppose it.</p>
<p>And we will continue to work with volunteers, organizations, and state lawmakers to pass statutes that would protect the rights of parents in the individual states. This will include supporting legislation that would roll back participation in Common Core, and resisting legislation that would formalize it, in any given state.</p>
<p>We trust you will stand with us in these efforts as they arise. Could you also <a href="https://secure.parentalrights.org/np/clients/parentalrights/donation.jsp?campaign=5&amp;=&amp;utm_source=website&amp;utm_campaign=commoncore" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">make a generous donation</a> today to help us continue our mission of protecting children by empowering parents, not only with the Parental Rights Amendment, but also with knowledge about threats like the Common Core?</p>

<![CDATA[<p>[Updated 6/6/17]</p>
<p>Last week the SXSWedu Technology Conference in Austin, Texas, featured a new project that has many educational technology companies very excited – and that has many parents angry and deeply concerned. The project is called inBloom – <strong>a massive national database of personal information on public school students – and it is already up and running.</strong> Largely funded by the pro-internationalist Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, the $100 million project contains information on millions of children to date.</p>
<p>So far, at least 9 states are using or planning to use the system: Colorado, Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, New York, and North Carolina.</p>
<p>But parents in New York are furious that <strong>their child’s information is being shared with private companies</strong> “to create a national database for businesses that contract with public schools,” according to the <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/student-data-compiling-system-outrages-article-1.1287990" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Daily News</a>.</p>
<p>Data being stored includes identifying information such as name, address, and social security number, along with school grades, attendance, and even information on hobbies, interests, and attitudes toward school.</p>
<p>School boards and education materials producers are very excited. Product Manager Jeffrey Olen of CompassLearning, an education software company, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/03/us-education-database-idUSBRE92204W20130303" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told Reuters</a>, “This is going to be a huge win for us.” And Brandon Williams, a director at the Illinois State Board of Education, told them, “We look at personalized learning as the next big leap forward in education.”</p>
<p>But parents are equally “excited” – and deeply concerned – about all of that data being collected about their child and stored in a massive database with nationwide access by anyone with whom the school system would like to share it. And that’s saying nothing of hackers who might get at it illegally.</p>
<p>The Electronic Privacy Law Center in Washington is suing the U.S. Department of Education over this issue. Their administrative counsel, Khaliah Barnes, told the Daily News, “<strong>It’s a lot of smoke and mirrors. What happens if a company using the data is compromised?</strong> What happens if the company goes out of business? We don’t know the answers.”</p>
<p>Donna Lieberman of the New York Civil Liberties Union is also concerned. “<strong>Turning massive amounts of personal data about public school students to a private corporation without any public input is profoundly disturbing and irresponsible</strong>,” she told the Daily News. Her organization has blasted the state for not giving parents any notice of the plan or the opportunity to opt their child out of the program.</p>
<p>Those who believe there is no need for a Parental Rights Amendment tend to fall into one of two groups. Either they believe the government would never really threaten the right of fit parents to direct the upbringing of their child, or they believe the government would make better decisions than most parents. Secretly shipping personal and educational data on millions of school students to a private corporation seems like an excellent way to prove both of these groups wrong. Far more important, it leaves the identities, reputations, privacy, and future of our children at stake.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>By now, the experience can only be called “commonplace.” You take your child to the doctor for a rash or a sore throat, and the next thing you know your child is fielding some unrelated questions: “Is there a gun in your home? Do you usually wear a seatbelt when riding in the car? What’s your favorite music?”</p>
<p>If you haven’t yet heard such a dialogue between your child and the doctor, that doesn’t mean this is not occurring.<strong> “Doctors are trained in residency how to gently steer the parent out of the room so that they can do an assessment,”</strong> reports pediatrician and ParentalRights.org board member Verlainna Callentine, M.D. “The mindset is that because so many adolescents stay healthy, there are few opportunities to have a medical impact on the child once they get out of the early years of development. When a child comes in for a particular complaint, the opportunity is seized to assess other risk factors in the child’s life.”</p>
<p>Dr. Callentine continues, “Absolutely, it can be intrusive. It is intentional. Some doctors may not want parents to know the kinds of questions being asked out of fear that the answers they will receive from the child will not be honest and truthful.”</p>
<p>This line of questioning is called a “psychosocial evaluation”. There are many of these evaluation tools used in pediatric offices. One such tool is the HEEADSSS assessment, and it has been around for years. HEEADSSS is an acronym for the myriad topics the probe is intended to cover: <strong>H</strong>ome, <strong>E</strong>ducation &amp; Employment, <strong>E</strong>ating &amp; Exercise, <strong>A</strong>ctivities and Peer Relationships, <strong>D</strong>rug /Cigarette/Alcohol Use, <strong>S</strong>exuality, <strong>S</strong>uicide &amp; Depression, and <strong>S</strong>afety. Some will also include Spirituality, including questions like “Does your family affiliate with any faith community?” and “How often do you go to church/synagogue/mosque/etc.?”</p>
<p>You won’t believe some of the questions doctors are being urged to ask your child. <a href="http://parentalrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/19_Appendix_2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here to see one such questionnaire.</a>
</p>
<p>
<strong>If government doctors were using this, there would be constitutional issues immediately.</strong> Private doctors, however, are not limited by the Constitution. So while some doctors in certain instances could <em>possibly</em> be held liable for invasion of privacy, the best defense is to be aware and prepared to avoid the problem entirely.</p>
<p>
<strong>“Parents need to be educated and understand how to navigate the healthcare system with their child,”</strong> Dr. Callentine says. “They need to know they have the right to say, ‘No’ or to request to be present during the discussion so they can best partner with the healthcare provider. Parents are the advocate for their children. It is through a ‘healthy’ partnership with their pediatrician that parents and children can best be served.”</p>
<p>“We need to educate the parents,” Dr. Rosemary Stein, an adjunct teaching professor at the Children’s Hospital of UNC-Chapel Hill, agrees.</p>
<p>According to Dr. Stein, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) set up a committee several years ago to promote ratification of the United Nations’ Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) in the United States. That committee is linked very strongly to medical teaching programs across the country, using its influence to see that the international model – including HEEADSSS assessments – is presented as “the way to practice medicine” in the U.S. (Dr. Stein was a fellow of the AAP until resigning over philosophical differences.)</p>
<p>The HEEADSSS assessment was first introduced by Americans G.M. Cohen and E. Goldenring in Contemporary Pediatrics in 1988. Obviously, then, it didn’t come from the United Nations. However, the implementation of HEEADSSS and of the United Nations’ Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) can have striking parallels. That is because <strong>both include the notable presumption that parents are agents to be monitored rather than the natural safeguard for their children’s health and rights.</strong>
</p>
<p>This shared premise makes it easy to employ the CRC and the HEEADSSS assessment together to impede parental rights around the world. The New South Wales (Australia) Center for the Advancement of Adolescent Health (NSW CAAH) has published a popular “Resource Kit” to help doctors learn to administer these assessments. According to their website, the NSW CAAH “believe[s] that all young people have the right to comprehensive health care,” a catch-phrase in international law signifying the “right” of teenagers to make health decisions– especially in the areas of drug use and sexuality (including abortion) – without parental oversight, input, or consent. Not coincidentally, this “right” is often called for by the Committee on the Rights of the Child, which consistently interprets Article 24 of the CRC to include this obligation.</p>
<p>
<strong>The mindset is the same: parents are an obstruction that must be removed from the room so that the needs of adolescents can be met</strong>.</p>
<p>While it is true that there are rare instances where that is in fact the case, fit parents have the fundamental right to direct the care of their children – and that includes the right to grant or deny consent for a doctor to perform a “psychosocial assessment” of your child.</p>
<p>Sadly, the rise of electronic medical records and the drift toward government health care point to a day when the data collected through these assessments will find its way into the hands of the government. And the push to ratify the CRC could introduce a day when the assessment is seen as a legal necessity to fulfill the government’s obligation to ensure the best interests of every child.</p>
<p>
<strong>For now, though, you do have the right to say, “No.”</strong> When the doctor asks you to leave the room for the sake of your child’s privacy, the two of you together – you and your child – have all the legal authority to protect your family against this intrusion. Many states allow the doctor to honor your teen’s wishes over your own, but not to insert the doctor’s own wishes over those of you and your child together.</p>
<p>
<strong>The proposed Parental Rights Amendment to the United States Constitution will ensure that this right of parents “to direct the upbringing, education, and care of their child” will remain “a fundamental right.”</strong> It will prevent ratification of the CRC and halt the intrusion of the government into your home and privacy. It will also guarantee that no law is passed to take away your right to tell an intrusive doctor, “No.”</p>
<p>
<strong>Help Us Educate Parents</strong>
</p>
<p>You can help us educate parents about this and other threats to their families in two key ways.</p>
<p>First, <strong>pass this email on to your friends and family</strong> who may not realize that they are a customer with rights when they take their child to the doctor. Encourage them to support the Parental Rights Amendment as a means to protect these rights.</p>
<p>Second, <a href="https://secure.parentalrights.org/np/clients/parentalrights/donation.jsp?campaign=5&amp;=&amp;utm_source=newsletterarchive" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
<strong>donate to ParentalRights.org today*</strong>

<strong>When we were in school, several parents were there on a regular basis helping out in the classroom or the library,</strong> chaperoning field trips, or leading special reading or art programs. They were just doing their part to improve our education.</p>
<p>But parents are not allowed in public schools today. Sure, there are those increasingly rare exceptions. But in general, a parent cannot even visit, let alone sit in on a class or become a regular part of the classroom community. And those terrific school districts sprinkled around the country who do still allow parents entrance grant it as a privilege, not as a parental right.</p>
<p>
<em>Washington Times</em> columnist Jay Matthews recently lamented this fact in an article called “What’s Wrong with Parents Visiting a School?” Matthews had spoken with two sets of parents, each of whom had asked to sit in on a class with their child, whom they were looking to enroll in the school. In each case – one in Fairfax, VA and the other in Arlington – the answer was a solid, “No.”</p>
<p>That’s not to say schools should open their doors to just anyone. But Matthews’ article highlights the bigger picture – even parents familiar to the school and with children in attendance are being walled out by government regulations and bureaucratic policies.</p>
<p>We have come a long way from the 1986 Department of Education report which asserted – as the first principle in the <em>Classroom</em> section of the report – that <strong>“Parental involvement helps children learn more effectively.”</strong> And by depriving our schools of the parental presence, these policies have robbed the parents, the teachers, and especially the students of a terrific resource.</p>
<p>So, what if you are that parent and your child is in that school? How can you impact what and how your child learns? The answer is, you can’t.</p>
<p>According to the Supreme Court’s decision in <em>Pierce v. Society of Sisters</em> (1925), citing <em>Meyer v. Nebraska</em> (1923), any government action that “unreasonably interferes with the liberty of parents or guardians to direct the upbringing and education of children under their control” is unconstitutional. That’s the good news.</p>
<p>The bad news is that the Ninth Circuit determined in <em>Fields v. Palmdale</em> (2005) “that the <em>Meyer-Pierce</em> right… does not entitle individual parents to enjoin school boards from providing information the boards determine to be appropriate….” And the current Supreme Court has chosen not to review that court’s decision, leaving it as binding law in the west and as a dangerous precedent for the rest of the country.</p>
<p>So<strong> once your child steps onto school grounds, you no longer have a say.</strong> You have been effectively “walled out,” and the schools can do and teach whatever they want. Here’s what the court in the <em>Palmdale</em> case decided:</p>
<p>
<em>“Parents…have no constitutional right… to prevent a public school from providing its students with whatever information it wishes to provide…when and as the school determines that it is appropriate to do so…. Although the parents are legitimately concerned with the subject of sexuality, there is no constitutional reason to distinguish that concern from any of the countless other moral, religious, or philosophical objections that parents might have to other decisions of the School District – whether those objections regard information concerning guns, violence, the military, gay marriage, racial equality, slavery, the dissection of animals, or the teaching of scientifically-validated theories of the origins of life.”</em>
</p>
<p>Will schools continue to wall out all parents as they have in recent years? That remains to be seen. But one thing we already know – we as <strong>parents are powerless to stop them, unless we take a stand</strong> and demand that traditional parental rights be restored!</p>

<![CDATA[<p>[Updated 6/6/17]</p>
<p>If your children attend public school, you are among those parents whose rights will end the moment your child enters the school. That’s because in 2005 the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals found in <em>Fields v. Palmdale School District</em> “that the <em>Meyer-Pierce </em>right [of parents to direct the upbringing of their children] does not exist beyond the threshold of the school door.”</p>
<p>You read that right. Parental Rights “<em>[do] not exist</em> beyond the threshold of the school door.”<sup>1</sup>
</p>
<p>“We conclude that the parents are possessed of <em>no constitutional right </em>to prevent the public schools from providing information on the subject [of sexuality] to their students <em>in any forum or manner they select</em>” (emphasis added).</p>
<p>Of course, most parents would contend that they don’t have a choice in where their children are schooled. Either economic constraints or personal circumstances leave them with no practical alternative to the local public school (which, after all, their taxes are paying for). And that leaves no parental rights at all.</p>
<p>
<strong>Please act to reverse this assault by big government courts against parental rights.</strong> <a href="https://secure.parentalrights.org/survey.jsp?surveyId=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sign up for our email alerts</a> and get more information at <a href="https://parentalrights.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ParentalRights.org</a>.</p>
<p>Then, <strong>please pass this on</strong>. Every parent of a public school student needs to know the extent to which the courts have robbed them of their rights. Use the share buttons below to add it to virtually any other social network.<br>

<p>The courts’ disregard for the traditional formative role of parents in a child’s life needs to be brought to light. And while the Parental Rights Amendment will not give parents any greater power to control the school’s choice of curriculum, it will protect their right to pull their individual child out of any program of an outrageous or offensive nature, like the program in the <em>Palmdale</em> case.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
